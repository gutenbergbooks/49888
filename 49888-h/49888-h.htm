<hr class="r5" />

<p class="parag"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SCENE</span>.&mdash;<i>A ravine amid the slopes of Mount Carmel.
On one side a hermitage, on the other a rustic
cross. The sun is about to set in the sea, which
fills the background</i>.</p>
<hr class="r5" />

<p class="parag">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. Thou who wast tempted in the wilderness,<br />
Guard me this night, for there are snares in sleep<br />
That baffle watching. O poisoned, bitter life<br />
Of doubt and longing! Were death possible,<br />
Who would not choose it? But that dim estate<br />
Might plunge my witless ghost in grosser matter<br />
And in still closer meshes choke my life.<br />
Yet thus to live is grievous agony,<br />
When sleep and thirst, hunger and weariness,<br />
And the sharp goads of thought-awakened lust<br />
Torture the flesh, and inward doubt of all<br />
Embitters with its lurking mockery<br />
Virtue's sad victories. This wilderness<br />
Whither I fly from the approach of men<br />
Keeps not the devil out. The treacherous glens<br />
Are full of imps, and ghosts in moonlit vesture<br />
Startle the watches of the lidless night.<br />
The giant forest, in my youth so fair,<br />
Is now a den of demons; the hoarse sea<br />
Is foul with monsters hungry for my soul;<br />
The dark and pregnant soil, once innocent<br />
Mother of flowers, reeks with venomous worms,<br />
And sore temptation is in all the world.<br />
But hist! A sound, as if of clanking hoofs.<br />
Saint Anthony protect me from the fiend,<br />
Whether he come in guise of horned beast<br />
Or of pernicious man! If I must die<br />
Be it upon this hallowed ground, O Lord!<br />
</p>

<p class="parag">[<i>Hides in the hut.</i></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p class="parag"><i>Enter a young</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p class="parag">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span> [<i>reining in his horse</i>].<br />
<br />
Rest, Albus, rest.&mdash;Doth the sun sink in glory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Because he sinks to rise?&mdash;</span><br />
Breathe here a space; here bends the promontory,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There Acra's haven lies.</span><br />
Those specks are galleys waiting for the gale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To make for Christian shores.</span><br />
To-morrow they will fly with bellying sail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And plash of swinging oars,</span><br />
Bearing us both to where the freeman tills<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The plot where he was born,</span><br />
And belfry answers belfry from the hills<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above the fields of corn.</span><br />
Thence one less sea to traverse ere we come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where all our hopes abide,</span><br />
One truant journey less to end in home,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy mistress, and my bride. [<i>He dismounts.</i></span><br />
Good Albus, 't is enough for one day's riding.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here shall our bivouac be.</span><br />
Surely by that green sward some brook is hiding<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To welcome thee and me.</span><br />
Yes, hark! Its laugh betrays it. Graze thou there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor fear the camp's alarms.</span><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="parag">[<i>Lets the horse go and turns, perceiving the
cross on the hillside.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="parag">
See where a cross, inviting me to prayer,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Outspreads its sacred arms.</span><br />
O first of many that mine eyes shall see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On altar, tomb, and tower,</span><br />
Art thou the last of crosses come to me<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before my guerdon's hour?</span><br />
Or first or last, and by whatever hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Here planted in the wild,</span><br />
Hail to thee, cross, that blessest in far lands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy champion and thy child.</span><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="parag">[<i>Goes up to the cross and kneels before it.<br />
The angel of the Lord appeared to Mary<br />
And she conceived of the Holy Ghost.</i></p>

<p class="parag">[<i>Continues silently.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="parag">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span> [<i>from within].</i><br />
<br />
All's quiet. God hath made the danger pass.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="parag">[<i>Comes out.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="parag">
Nay, hold! A horse without a rider here?<br />
Perchance a devil, come, if I should mount him,<br />
To gallop with me into yawning hell.<br />
Yet he looks gentle, munching the young grass,<br />
The tempting bridle looped about his neck.<br />
I will go catch him. When the traders pass&mdash;<br />
And they pass after Christmas&mdash;I will barter<br />
The beast for a good cloak. The winter's blasts<br />
Are on us.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <i>Behold the handmaid of the Lord.</i><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;"><i>Be't done to me according to thy word</i>&mdash;</span><br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="parag">[<i>Confutes silently</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p class="parag">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. A voice! A Christian voice! Some winged angel<br />
Floats through the ether, magnifying God.<br />
Merciful heaven! There, ay, there he kneels<br />
Before the cross I planted. 'T is the cross<br />
That to earth brings down heaven. Yes, Saint Michael,<br />
For he is clad in arms, and his casque fringed<br />
With the bright nimbus of his golden hair.<br />
Yet he seems wingless; if he stirs a limb<br />
The heavy armour clangs. No angel, surely;<br />
Rather Saint George, with steed and magic lance<br />
Returned to fight against the infidel.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <i>And the Word was made flesh and dwelt<br />
among us.[Continues silently.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. Listen! they speak my native tongue in heaven.<br />
Those are the words my sainted mother spake&mdash;<br />
Nightly she crooned them, teaching Palmerin<br />
His orisons.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="parag">[<i>The</i> <span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span> <i>rises.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="parag">
<span style="margin-left: 6.5em;">Come, shall I challenge him?</span><br />
No: I am foul. I will hide crouching here<br />
And spy him as he goes.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. What stirreth there?<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="parag">[<i>Pushes a branch aside.</i></p></blockquote>

<p class="parag">
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span> [<i>falling on his knees].</i><br />
Have mercy, glorious Saint! a sinful man<br />
Lives in this hovel; no man's enemy<br />
Except his own. Sir, spare an anchorite.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. Fear nothing, holy man. I am a Christian<br />
Although no saint, but sinful more than thou<br />
Who in the desert livest near to God.<br />
My sword is stained with blood, my heart is rash,<br />
And if my youth is free from foul dishonour<br />
'T is God's good mercies hedge my wayward days<br />
And marvellously guide me through the world.<br />
But thou art surely wise. In solitude<br />
The mind of the Most High possesseth men,<br />
And they whom sorrow chaseth from the world<br />
Learn in their grief the purposes of heaven.<br />
God's hand appears in this, that here I find thee<br />
To shrive me, father. Many months I roam<br />
Through heathen wilds in sorry need of shrift.<br />
Who knows if in some luckless fray to-morrow<br />
I bite the dust, or in that golden sea<br />
Perish unknelled and far from Christendom?<br />
A soldier's soul should be like his bright blade<br />
Ready to unsheathe.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 6em;">O music of high thoughts!</span><br />
O harmony of long-forgotten words!<br />
Fair visitation! In her youth the soul,<br />
Gathering, the heavy heritage of Adam,<br />
Looks with strange horror on her own abyss<br />
And on the stars, and her increasing knowledge<br />
Ever increaseth sorrow; yet with years,<br />
Touching the depths and wholly mortified,<br />
She sees her desert bloom with mystic flowers<br />
And sweeter smiles of God. O mortal bosom<br />
Both in foreboding and in hope beguiled!<br />
Not where I fancied in my night of trouble<br />
Dawns comfort on mine eyes, but wondrously.<br />
Whence earnest thou? Tell me what princely house<br />
And fruitful country bred and nurtured thee.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. 'T is not a fruitful land. On heathered hills<br />
My father fed his flocks. We gazed not down<br />
On vineyard slopes and waters blue as these<br />
But there a sea of swaying tree-tops spread<br />
Boundless beneath us, without path or tower,<br />
Save where beside the river's bend the monks<br />
Had built their cells and cleared the wood away.<br />
We called it milking time when we could hear<br />
The distant music of their matin chimes.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. Be your monks rich?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Their fields are ploughed and brown</span><br />
But the poor upland shepherd has no corn;<br />
His flock must feed him with its milk and flesh,<br />
Unless he snare a partridge in the wood<br />
As I did oft, or standing in the brook<br />
Where the green water eddies in the pool<br />
Enmesh the foolish fishes.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Never shepherd</span><br />
Could bear these arms or show this courtesy.<br />
Where wast thou bred, if thou wast born a hind,<br />
That thou art gentle? Who hath knighted thee?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. The Baron of the Marches is my liege;<br />
To him I owe my nurture and my sword,<br />
And the sweet hope that leads me.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Ah, the faith?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. Nay, that my mother gave me with her prayers,<br />
Saintliest of women.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thy mother and my own</span><br />
Were then alike. Hast thou another hope<br />
Sweeter than faith to thank thy master for?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. He hath a daughter for whose hand I serve,<br />
Having her love; and on the happy night<br />
When I kept vigil o'er the virgin arms<br />
In which I should be knighted at the dawn<br />
He promised me her hand, if I proved worthy<br />
In five years' service. At the morrow's mass<br />
When we had both partaken of the Lord,<br />
I knelt before him, and while all his vassals<br />
Stood in a ring about us, up he rose<br />
And with his flat sword struck my shoulder thus,<br />
Speaking these words, now graven on my heart:<br />
"Arise, Sir Knight, to battle with the world<br />
For God and honour. If in youth thou fall,<br />
May thy bright soul take instant wing to heaven,<br />
But if thou blazon on this argent shield<br />
Valorous deeds, and come in safety back,<br />
Thy worth shall stand in lieu of ancient blood,<br />
For valour was the first nobility,<br />
And with the blessing of a hapless man<br />
Whom three brave sons, reversing nature's sentence,<br />
Condemned to mourn them, I will then deliver<br />
My daughter to thy hands. She and her honour,<br />
My lands, my castle, and my name be thine.?<br />
Love is the hope, sweeter than faith in heaven,<br />
For which I toil in arms.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 13em;">Enough of that.</span><br />
Methinks thou art a priest, and ere I leave thee<br />
I fain would make confession of what sins<br />
Lie on my soul."<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. God knoweth what they are,<br />
And hath, methinks, forgiven them already,<br />
For by the candour of thy looks I know<br />
Thou livest in his grace. But tell them o'er,<br />
For by the speaking of a word the heart<br />
Is lightened of its burden: and the Lord<br />
Commissioned us to listen in his name<br />
To all men's woes, and counsel and forgive.<br />
Therefore say on.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. Alas, where all is frail<br />
I know not with what sorrow to begin.<br />
If I could keep the thought of God alive<br />
I might live better; but my wit is loose<br />
And wanders into silly dreams awake,<br />
All to no purpose. Everything that stirs<br />
Sets me athinking of its life and ways<br />
And I forget my own. If a frog jump,<br />
Or busy squirrel run across my path,<br />
Or three sad crows fly cawing through the wood,<br />
Or if I spy a fox's trail, or print<br />
Of deer's foot in the mould&mdash;off go my thoughts<br />
And I am many leagues in fairy land<br />
Before I shake away the lethargy<br />
And say to my weak soul, Thou art a knight,<br />
What hast thou done to-day?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Be these thy sins?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. Nay, not the chief. For in all exercise,<br />
Or when in any test or feat of arms<br />
I meet another, not the worthy cause,<br />
The thought of God, my liege, or beauteous mistress<br />
Strengthens my arm, but the mere rage and pride<br />
Of the encounter sweeps my soul along,<br />
And win I must, whatever goal it be,<br />
When I am once engaged. That's in the blood.<br />
So were our heathen fathers wont to fight<br />
Merciless battles. But glory is the Lord's<br />
Who metes with measure. Still I stumble there.<br />
And envy, too, I often sin in that,<br />
For from my childhood up I never brooked<br />
A swifter runner, or a quicker eye<br />
To hit the mark, and what another does<br />
Better than I, that still I strive to do<br />
Till he be worsted. Else I cannot sleep.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. Thou knowest, child, that victory is God's<br />
To give and to deny. He gives it thee:<br />
'T is proof of thy deserving. Use it well,<br />
Which if thou do, to crave the victory<br />
In thee, a soldier, is no grievous sin.<br />
But hast thou not more special sins than these,<br />
No wrong, no murder?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Murder have I none,</span><br />
If murder be to kill a man by stealth<br />
Or in a private quarrel, but in war<br />
I oft have slain my man. I wear a sword<br />
Though nature gave me not a butcher's hand<br />
That loves to use it.&mdash;Oh, 't is marvellous<br />
How men will slaughter for the sake of blood,<br />
And Christians too. Before I crossed the sea,<br />
The Margrave fought a battle in the north<br />
Against the heathen. I then followed him,<br />
And when the fight was over and the foe,<br />
Routed, had fled into a deep morass<br />
Black 'neath the splendours of a fiery sky,<br />
The bugle called us back: and back I rode,<br />
My shield slung on my back, my visor up,<br />
Saying the Angelus, such peace there was<br />
Beneath the twilight heavens, when a groan<br />
That seemed the ending of a soul in pain<br />
Made me look down; there lay a heathen knight,<br />
And on his wounded breast a Christian crouched,<br />
Stabbing him still; I snatched the villain's sword,<br />
But just in time, and seized him by the throat<br />
Amazed, and loud with oaths; "Thou slave," quoth I,<br />
"Why wilt thou send a valiant soul to hell,<br />
That might be saved for heaven? The man is mine.<br />
Take thou his armour, if some happy chance<br />
Have made thee victor. But outrage not the cause<br />
Which thou wouldst well defend." We stripped the man,<br />
Whose gaping wounds were deep and hard to staunch<br />
With the few strips remaining of my tunic<br />
Torn in the fight; and as he could not sit,<br />
We needs must lift and bear him in our arms<br />
Back to the camp. He was a knight indeed,<br />
And when, his fever passing, I explained<br />
Our holy faith&mdash;(our chaplains spoke not well<br />
His northern tongue)&mdash;he listened open-eyed<br />
As a child might, and when I stopped and asked,<br />
"Dost thou believe?" he gazed and said: "I do.<br />
As thou believest, so in life and death<br />
Will I believe."&mdash;So humble was his soul<br />
And open to the sudden grace of heaven.<br />
Yet him my Christian ruffian would have slain<br />
To see the red blood ooze. 'T is pitiful!<br />
And yet I do him wrong. The fellow came<br />
The morning after, shy, with heavy looks,<br />
And said he begged to bring the armour back.<br />
It was not his, he had not felled the knight<br />
But found him on the ground; and when I bade him<br />
Retain the proffered sword, to use it better,<br />
He sobbed aloud, and bathed my hands in tears,<br />
So hearty was his grief.&mdash;But I confess<br />
Another's sins, good father, and forget<br />
My own, which I should tell of.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Trouble not</span><br />
To tell them over, for I know them now.<br />
They are the same which seen in other men<br />
The world calls virtues. But one vice there is<br />
Which noblest natures in their youth are prone to.<br />
Hast thou offended against chastity?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. Ah, father, I am guilty too in that,<br />
If whosoever looketh on a woman<br />
Unholily, already hath committed<br />
Adultery in his heart. 'T is in my thoughts,<br />
Perhaps, that I have sinned; but I am young,<br />
And have from childhood loved one noble maid.<br />
All other faces are but mirrors to me<br />
Of what she is in truth. When others smile<br />
And seem to say that haply they could love me,<br />
My heart yearns to them, yet its yearning goes<br />
Like incense past a picture, to her spirit.<br />
They are memorials of her I review<br />
To make me constant. Nay, but that's not all.<br />
A heavy season comes,&mdash;I know not whether<br />
At waxing or at waning of the moon,&mdash;<br />
When but the babble of a girlish voice<br />
Heard from a window, or a hand stretched forth,<br />
Or a chance motion, stops the beating heart<br />
Here in my breast, and melts my very soul,<br />
And I stand there bewitched, my brain benumbed,<br />
And nothing in me but the fell desire<br />
To do I know not what.&mdash;'T is dreams, dreams, dreams,<br />
And they are evil, treacherous, and base<br />
When they come so. One day on every side<br />
They girt me round. I cried to them "For shame!"<br />
They would not go nor quit tormenting me<br />
Till I put spurs into my steed, and rode,<br />
Rode with clenched teeth, hacking all branches off<br />
Within my axe's compass. When I stopped<br />
My soul was free: "We have outridden them,<br />
Albus," I cried, "the demons of that place<br />
Of foul enchantment! Here's the blue again<br />
Smiling upon us, God, and all his saints."<br />
Father, methinks the agony of death<br />
May happen so. A stifling darkness comes<br />
Upon the feeble soul, and doubtfully<br />
She keeps her strength alive on far-off hopes<br />
In that great stress of anguish. But it passes<br />
And slowly we awake in paradise.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. In paradise, my son, when thou awakest<br />
If I still suffer in the lake of fire<br />
Make me some prayerful alms, who in the name<br />
Of God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost<br />
Absolve thee now.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 4em;">And for my penance, father,</span><br />
What lay you on?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 4em;">Three <i>Aves</i> for three days</span><br />
Say for the soul of one unlike thyself<br />
Though of thy country. Robbers bore him thence<br />
Into their kingdoms. Hast thou never heard<br />
Tell of the hordes that ravaged Christendom<br />
Ere thou wast born, belike.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Nay, I remember.</span><br />
'T was then my mother brought me from the hills<br />
To dwell beside the castle, for the Huns<br />
Had slain my father and my elder brother<br />
And driven the sheep away.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">The Huns? The Huns?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. Ay, when they ravaged all the land about<br />
Upon their western march.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">They slew thy brother?</span><br />
Thou sawest his body?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Nay, we saw it not.</span><br />
We fled, and many fearful weeks were past<br />
Ere we returned to search.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">The Lord is great.</span><br />
Thy brother's name was&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Damian.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 10em;">God of mercies,</span><br />
What shall become of us!<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Thy gaze is fixed.</span><br />
What ails thee? Rest thee there.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 10em;">I cannot speak.</span><br />
I faint. Since dawn I have not tasted food.<br />
A draught! A morsel! Ah, my end is near.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. I have a panier by my saddle-bow<br />
With food.&mdash;Albus has wandered down the glade.&mdash;<br />
I shall be here anon. [<i>Exit.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 6em;">What bodes this portent?</span><br />
My practised soul well knows the things of earth,<br />
And there is none like this. Impossible.<br />
This is some essence metaphysical,<br />
And not the thing it seems. So much is sure;<br />
But whether fiend or minister of grace<br />
How shall I know? Is he a subtle demon<br />
And wins my ear? I am the devil's pawn.<br />
Is he an angel and I put him by?<br />
Then I am damned for that. All other sins<br />
Shall be forgiven, save such blasphemy<br />
Against the Holy Ghost. And being dead<br />
Might not my brother's spirit come from heaven?<br />
And though I be unworthy in my sins<br />
Of saintly visitation, I believe<br />
This vision is from God. 'T is beautiful<br />
And clothed in Christian speech and charity.<br />
Was not Mount Carmel, Lord, thy haunt of old<br />
Where men went up to meet thee? Show thy face.<br />
The Apostles at Emmaus knew the Lord<br />
When he broke bread. Blind heart, an angel comes<br />
To sup with thee to-night. Misknow him not.<br />
The ravens of Elijah, who were black,<br />
Came from the Lord, and Raphael himself<br />
Who led the lost Tobias by the hand<br />
Was black beside this vision's loveliness.<br />
Yea, by its glory pale the three bright strangers<br />
That from the desert came to Abraham's tent<br />
In figure of the blessed Trinity.&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What am I raving? Am I Abraham,</span><br />
Tobias, or Elijah, that the gods<br />
Should visit me? Did not the artful devil<br />
Come to Saint Anthony in beauteous form?<br />
When first this ghost approached I dreaded him,&mdash;<br />
A certain sign. Yet by his subtle wiles,<br />
Flattering my earthly hopes, he vanquished me<br />
And quieted my doubts&mdash;as if Beelzebub<br />
Could not feign piety to murder souls!<br />
What, my young brother, whom I counted dead,<br />
Found in this shape, a knight, a Paladin,<br />
A vision such as minstrels sing about?<br />
Palpable lie, abominable snare<br />
The demon mocks me with! Let me but cry,<br />
"I am thy brother, I am Damian,"<br />
Let me but clasp his knees and with a flood<br />
Of joyful penitential childish tears<br />
Water his feet, and then look up again<br />
To drink the grace of his benignant eyes<br />
And by his kiss be healed in soul and body,<br />
And I shall see the grinning demon's self<br />
And feel that icy manacle, his claw,<br />
Clasping my wrist for ever. "Thou art damned,<br />
Damned," shrieks the fiend, "damned in believing lies,<br />
Damned in renouncing for a dreamful joy<br />
Thy solitude and penance. Thou art damned."<br />
Yes, 't is a hellish plot confronts me here.<br />
A knight, my brother, come to comfort me!<br />
'T is madness and wild dreams.&mdash;Again he comes.<br />
His gesture says, Here's food. Pitiful heaven,<br />
Assist me now. Let me not now be lost.<br />
Suffer my vigils and perpetual fasts<br />
To strengthen my resolve. To be so happy<br />
Were rash, and ah, how vain! To drown their sorrow<br />
Fools barter heaven for a drunkard's joy.<br />

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. Drink this. 'T is water from the virgin springs<br />
Of Carmel, pure and cold. Stains of the world<br />
That leave the heavens clean leave earth's own heart<br />
Immaculate. 'T is but her outer garment<br />
That man and roving beast avail to smear.<br />
The curse of Adam stops at living things<br />
And Nature sleeps untainted. There is healing<br />
In such a fountain draught. Taste of this bread.<br />
Acorns I also bring and well-dried figs.<br />
Take freely: there is plenteous store for both.<br />
For often as I ride a village through<br />
Or tighten as I start from hostelries<br />
My horse's girth, the hospitable dame<br />
Or her young daughter brings me something forth<br />
From the rich larder, now a loaf or fowl<br />
And now a goat-skin full of seasoned wine.<br />
God prompts their kindly hearts and makes them bounteous<br />
Lest my strength fail me ere my journey's end,<br />
Who knows how distant yet.&mdash;Come, break thy fast.<br />
Remember, father, this is Christmas Eve<br />
When angels, joining in the songs of earth,<br />
Make mortals joyful, knowing their painful flesh<br />
Allied to deity.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 4em;">I crave no food.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. Nay, nay, thy faintness called for it but now.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. Not hunger gave that cry but wonderment.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. At my poor brother's name?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Thy brother lives.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. Where? Dost thou know him? In this Holy Land?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. Poor Damian of the Marches! Verily<br />
His sins are scarlet. Pray for him, fair Knight,<br />
But seek not to discover his abode.<br />
If thou should st find him he would die of shame<br />
For bringing shame upon thee.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Hast thou seen him?</span><br />
Or is it slander of a gossip's mouth<br />
That now usurps thy tongue? If he be fallen<br />
He hath the greater need of charity<br />
And some late succour.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Through long wanderings</span><br />
We never once were parted. In his youth<br />
I deemed him honest, loved him as myself,<br />
Nor doubted he should richly thrive and prosper<br />
Amongst the sons of men. But day by day<br />
The hand of opportunity unmasked<br />
The sleeping guilt within. Envy and greed,<br />
Pitiless malice, pride, and wantonness<br />
Started like lion's cubs that scent their prey<br />
And roared increasingly. Time drew aside<br />
Veil after veil that cloaked his villainy,<br />
Till looking on his stark and naked soul<br />
I stood aghast and trembled.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">God, that made us,</span><br />
Engraved his sacred image in our hearts<br />
Deeper than cruel eyes may boast to pierce.<br />
Has not my brother too a priceless soul<br />
For which Christ died? Did God not ransom it?<br />
Yes, I will find him, lift him to my breast<br />
And say, "Forget the past. Thy home is here."<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. Beware! Didst thou embrace him he would die,<br />
And he hath grievous penance yet to do<br />
Ere he be ripe for heaven. In purgatory<br />
The pains are doubly sharp and manifold<br />
With which our guilt is cleansed. Forbear to search.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. This ministration is a task that heaven<br />
Now lays upon me. Hinder not his weal.<br />
What better battle could approve my courage<br />
Than in a brother's soul to fight despair?<br />
If I could bring that brother back to life<br />
Long dead to me, and dead, it seems, to God,<br />
Were't not a deed of Christian chivalry<br />
To win my lady by? Father, I pray thee,<br />
Where is my brother now?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">A mystery</span><br />
Enshrouds his penance. Vain to question more.<br />
A secret vow on which salvation hangs<br />
Lies between him and all men.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Marvellous!</span><br />
<br />
Where hath he roamed, what nameless sin committed<br />
That I may not embrace him?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Listen, Knight,</span><br />
<br />
For I may tell thee that; and when thou knowest<br />
The sins he shrives and what his penance is,<br />
Assist him with thy charitable prayers<br />
To bear his cross, but lift it not away,<br />
For with it goes his hope of paradise.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. There is indeed some mystery in this.<br />
The pain of it doth weigh upon thy soul<br />
Even in the telling.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Did his own pale lips</span><br />
Read from the branded tablets of his heart<br />
The record of his sorrows, they could never<br />
More truly speak than I, for all his woes<br />
I knew, and inly felt them as my own.<br />
Would that some ruffian knife had gashed his throat<br />
On that foul day of slaughter, when thy mother<br />
Bore thee afar to safety. Ah, how near<br />
Salvation hung that day above his head!<br />
But wondrously, as Isaac once was spared,<br />
Some voice he heard not stayed the murderous hand,<br />
Then dealing death abroad; and from that mercy<br />
The dreadful brood of all his torments sprang.<br />
<br />
They bound his wrists with painful twisted thongs<br />
And drove him with the flocks and captive women<br />
Into their camp, across the smouldering heaps<br />
Of burning rubbish and through sulphurous fumes.<br />
That night he found him tied behind a cart&mdash;<br />
The crawling palace of that savage chief<br />
Whose greed had saved him. Shivering he stood,<br />
For they had stripped him, through the starlight hours,<br />
And found no piteous orb less bright above him<br />
For looking on his grief. Alas, his soul<br />
Entered that night into the maze of hell.<br />
For gazing on those stars and on the corpses<br />
Of all he loved and knew, mangled and bare,<br />
Upbraiding heaven with their lidless eyes,<br />
And heaven's eyes still smiling back at them,<br />
He said to his cold heart, "There is no God."<br />
And when the rosy dawn with jocund seeming<br />
Gilded the valley as if naught had chanced,<br />
He, like the morning, banished grief and love,<br />
And in his vain and cruel heart repeating<br />
"There is no God," arose to greet the sun.<br />
They took him to a village by a stream,<br />
And in the market sold him to a Jew,<br />
A long-robed man, who stroked thy brother's hair&mdash;<br />
'T was flaxen then and silken as thy own&mdash;<br />
And chuckled as he hurried him away<br />
Into a galley, by the margin moored.<br />
They voyaged long, until they reached a vast<br />
And splendid city. Egypt's sunken shore<br />
Stretches behind it, and before its walls<br />
Pharos, by day a pillar and by night<br />
A flaming beacon, greets the mariner.<br />
'T is Satan's capital. If holy men<br />
Have dwelt within it, teaching all the Church,<br />
That was of old. Now Saracens and Jews<br />
Possess it wholly. There no Christian thrives,<br />
But every monstrous and lascivious crime<br />
Findeth a palace or a den to hide it.<br />
There did thy brother waste his youth, a slave,<br />
And no unwilling service did he render<br />
To every base command. His shepherd's skin,<br />
Ruddy with mountain suns, they smoothed with unguents,<br />
And bleached in pillared courts; they shaved his hair,<br />
Forbade him labour, save to hold a torch<br />
While his young masters read, or at the banquet<br />
To mix the lucent sherbets with the snows<br />
Of Sinai's deepest gorge, or in the censer<br />
To drop large incense-grains. He learned to sing<br />
What songs of wine their ribald poets penned,<br />
And all the witch of Lesbos raved of love.<br />
The lute and timbrel in his skilful hands<br />
They loved to place; oft in their languid souls<br />
His wild chant roused some savage memory<br />
And their hearts leapt like leopards in the night<br />
That prowl through broad Sahara. His delight<br />
Was henceforth the choice morsel, the fat fee,<br />
The subtle theft. He brought the gossip home<br />
From the loud market, lest his lord should yawn<br />
The morning long beneath the barber's hands,<br />
Nor praise his wit and to the tittering group<br />
Repeat his story. In the brothel streets<br />
He ran sly errands, nor escaped in fear<br />
If as he passed some wife of Potiphar<br />
Plucked at his tunic. His best art it was<br />
To know the cunning mixture of good wines<br />
And poisons too, if some adulterous slave<br />
Or long-lived uncle or importunate brother<br />
Needed a poison.&mdash;Close about his soul<br />
This bitter flood of luxury crept up<br />
Until it choked him. He forgot the past<br />
And blushed to be a Christian. Their vain prayers<br />
He learned to mutter, and was circumcised.<br />
Thrice in the day, and dawn and noon and eve,<br />
He washed his feet and hands, a foolish rite<br />
That left the soul still foul. Twice seven devils<br />
Lodged in his body and tormented him,<br />
And lust pursued him when all ways of lust<br />
Were stale and sickened.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">But there came an end.</span><br />
For by the flesh as he had chiefly sinned,<br />
So in the flesh he had his punishment.<br />
Ulcers and boils, to make another Job,<br />
Thickened upon him, and his beauty gone,<br />
They drove him like a pest from all their gates<br />
Among the lepers. Then he called on God.<br />
Then he remembered all he once had heard<br />
But understood not touching Calvary;<br />
And rising up, all naked as he was,<br />
He plucked the stout stem of a bramble-bush<br />
To be his palmer's staff, and with a rag<br />
That once had been the blanket of a mule<br />
Girded his loins, and stalked into the wild.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. And whither, father, whither did he go?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. Mount Sinai first received him, on whose crests<br />
The Lord in the beginning reared his throne,<br />
And from whose spurs and watered crevices<br />
The children of Saint Anthony for ever<br />
Pour praise and supplication. There he dwelt,<br />
Recalling to his troubled memory<br />
The precepts of the faith; but from those haunts<br />
He journeyed soon to deeper solitudes.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. Then he repented and is surely saved?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. God grant it, son, God grant it for thy sake.<br />
'T is not a day can change the heart of man,<br />
Though grace doth much. The ancient demons lurk<br />
Still in their dark recesses, and at night,<br />
Or in the idle moments when the soul<br />
Breathes 'mid her travail, suddenly assail.<br />
In the vast wilderness the starving eye<br />
Spies many shapes that feed its lust. To me<br />
The buzz of bees, the lizard's sunny sleep,<br />
The snake's lithe coils are full of languishment.<br />
Oh, how the base blood then assaults the heart<br />
Crying, "Fool, fool, what were the life of heaven<br />
Unless in heaven too the sun were warm<br />
And the blood rose and all the passions flared,<br />
Even as in worms compact of earth and fire<br />
That lecherously writhe? Their goads and stings<br />
Are in thy flesh, why not their ravishment?"<br />
<br />
They are strange shapes the devil sometimes takes.<br />
There was a vine that crept along this wall,<br />
Ancient and knotted; far its branches spread<br />
And with their leafy greenness made a bower<br />
Over my cell. The juicy clusters hung<br />
Not far above me, and the little birds<br />
Chirped in the sun-flecked tangle all day long,<br />
Hopping from twig to twig and carolling.<br />
I sat and listened, and methought they said:<br />
"Bad hairy man, thou only in this world<br />
Repinest, hater of thyself and us,<br />
Thou art all nature's single enemy."<br />
And with a doubt that cleft my heart in twain<br />
I sat and pondered what they sang to me.<br />
Then I looked up into the sunlit maze<br />
Of that old vine, I breathed its subtle scent,<br />
I watched its spotted shadows shift and change<br />
With gusty murmurous tremblings of its leaves<br />
And eager tendrils, curling through the air,<br />
Until it seemed as if the thing had life<br />
And was a devil stooping over me<br />
With the obsession of his purring breath<br />
Wooing me to perdition. But I laughed,<br />
For I had dealt with imps of hell before.<br />
I searched the stubble till I found two flints,<br />
Sharp and with something like a cross upon them,<br />
And straight about the vine's outspreading roots<br />
Began to dig. A week, methinks, I dug<br />
With secret joy, well knowing that in vain<br />
The demon thought to ripen all his grapes.<br />
His filthy roots, now dangling in the air,<br />
Dried in the sun. In August fell the leaves,<br />
And the dead branches with the autumn's flaw<br />
Rotted and broke; now, see, they feed my fire.<br />
And when the Spring returns no silly birds<br />
Will fret me with their singing. God be praise<br />
That I could balk that devil: long he mocked<br />
My lonely penance with his evil eye.<br />
But others come anon; and what I suffer<br />
'T is very like thy brother suffers too.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. I cannot think so, father. Thou art weak<br />
And long hast laid the hopes of youth aside.<br />
Thou canst not love. My brother still is young&mdash;<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. Alas, if grief had multiplied his years!<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. He yet can love, and any natural voice<br />
Of wood or mountain, or perchance my own,<br />
Might wake in him another better life<br />
Of peace and happy hopes. We love the forest,<br />
We who were nurtured in its magic depths.<br />
Oft has it seemed as if God spoke to us<br />
In the low voices of the prayerful boughs<br />
That whisper nighest heaven.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">This false world</span><br />
Is naught, my son, but what we make of it.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. Then I must think my brother loves the woods<br />
And hears God's message in their murmuring.<br />
Had he dwelt here, a hermit like thyself,<br />
He would have suffered that old vine to grow<br />
And those blithe birds to sing. 'T is positive,<br />
Else other blood than mine must fill his veins.<br />
Oh, I will find him yet.&mdash;I leave thee, father.<br />
Thou hast with heavy tidings and great hope<br />
Burdened my soul. Now I must journey on.<br />
I pray, thy blessing.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 5em;">Kneel, thou happy stranger,</span><br />
Kneel, for a vision comes into my heart<br />
And I must prophesy. Thus saith the Lord:<br />
"Thou shalt not know thy brother upon earth;<br />
My will forbids. But thou shalt pass him by,<br />
And as Saint Peter's shadow healed a man,<br />
The passing of thee, by my grace and mercy,<br />
Shall save thy brother's soul." This comfort take<br />
And go thy ways.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 5em;">The will of God be done.</span><br />
If not on earth, we yet may meet in heaven.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. God grant it.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 6em;">May God keep thee.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Fare thee well.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">KNIGHT</span> [<i>sings as he goes</i>].<br />
<br />
<i>The star stood still o'er Bethlehem</i><br />
<i>That showed the wise the way</i>,<br />
<i>And where the shepherds sleeping lay</i><br />
<i>The angels sang to them:</i><br />
<i>Glory be to God on high</i><br />
<i>And peace on earth to men.</i><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HERMIT</span>. Lord of Mount Carmel, hearken to my prayer.<br />
<br />
God of the hills, accept my sacrifice.<br />

Till the twitch comes.&mdash;Trust me, 't is hazardous,<br />
Sweet child, to tarry here beyond the moat<br />
Alone, when evening falls. Once at thy age<br />
My mother sent me on a night like this<br />
To good old Prior Bennet, at Saint Giles.<br />
He was her uncle and a saintly man&mdash;<br />
How well do I remember his grey beard!&mdash;<br />
She went to him for shrift, and on that day<br />
She had a fainting turn: she had them oft<br />
Till in the last, poor sainted soul, she died.<br />
I needs must run and fetch him, for to die<br />
Unreconciled was all my mother feared,<br />
And but for that, she had so hard a life<br />
She would have changed it any day for heaven,<br />
And on the way ('t was scarce a rood from home)<br />
An idle foul young lout that sauntered by<br />
Griped at my frock&mdash;I tremble at it still&mdash;<br />
Thank God, the Virgin willed that at the trice<br />
Friar Peter (he was porter all that month)<br />
Opened the gate to let two pilgrims out,<br />
Bound, as they told us, for Jerusalem.<br />
Else Heaven knows what had become of me,<br />
Or whether I had ever had the face<br />
To cheat my husband, as most wenches do,<br />
Without confessing aught: for I am honest<br />
If ever woman was.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">NURSE</span>. Seest thou not I go? Can I make haste<br />
With these poor aching joints? Thou think'st thee safe?<br />
Remember Ulric in his dungeon plans<br />
Vengeance upon you, and his friends abroad<br />
Hatch plans for his deliverance. Thou a maid,<br />
An orphan, friendless, with these ill-paid men<br />
Guarding thy walls, what dost thou fading here?<br />
Who knows but he is dead, thy pretty knight?<br />
His time is up. Were he alive and true<br />
He had spurred home, hearing thy father's death,<br />
To claim thee and make good his heritage.<br />
Fie on this fondness, girl! It had been wiser<br />
To yield to Ulric. Was it not his place<br />
To guard thee? Led he not thy father's men?<br />
Ah, better be his wife, rich, safe, and loved,<br />
Than wait for ever among enemies<br />
For what will never come.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FLERIDA</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Poor soul, go in.</span><br />
<br />
The five years are not passed, and if they were<br />
And I had ocular proof that he was dead,<br />
Ulric should not be master in these walls.<br />
But I should open arches in the tower<br />
For bells to swing in, and the grass should grow<br />
Upon the buried hinges of the draw.<br />
Veiled we should walk within the garden-close,<br />
And in the dimmed hall chant our psalmodies<br />
With the frail voice of nuns. So get thee gone,<br />
And summon better counsel to thy heart<br />
Than quavers on thy lips. Go light thy taper,<br />
And pray for the safe-coming of thy liege.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">NURSE</span>. I go. But thou, sweet lady, linger not.<br />
The victuals will grow cold, as many a night<br />
They have, since summer makes the twilight long<br />
And thou com'st late to supper.&mdash;Ah, poor bones!<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PALMERIN</span> [<i>raising her</i>].<br />
How gladly, if these keys unlock thy heart,<br />
Dear lady. For my prize is not these walls,<br />
Nor these stout men and honourable arms.<br />
'T was not for them I served the Emperor<br />
In many a battle waged in heathen lands.<br />
'T was in the hope of what no strength of arm<br />
Nor kingly favour, without grace of thine,<br />
Could win for any man. If thou canst love me,<br />
I take all else to do thee homage with;<br />
But if thy heart, in my long absence won<br />
By some more worthy suitor, would withdraw,<br />
Keep the rest too, for to be wretched in<br />
I have this whole vast world for heritage.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FLERIDA</span>. My hand and heart my father plighted thee<br />
Upon the morning when he dubbed thee knight.<br />
Both shall be true. If other ground were lacking,<br />
My father's choice were ground enough for love.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PALMERIN</span>. Nay, let not duty and thy father's will<br />
Force thee to wed me. Bid thy heart pronounce.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FLERIDA</span>. A holy love is not the fancy's choice.<br />
A mother cherishes the child she bore,<br />
Nature's dear gift, bestowed with many a pang<br />
And weary vigil and sweet fluttering joy<br />
That flies over a sea of brooding care.<br />
A father is not chosen but revered,<br />
For God appointed him. 'T is destiny,<br />
And no man's wayward will, binds brothers, kindred,<br />
And childhood's friends in everlasting bonds.<br />
Our native land we chose not, nor our king,<br />
Nor our first sovereign, God. All sacred ties<br />
Are woven round us by the hand of heaven<br />
And therefore bear us up. Let homeless traitors<br />
Reject their lot, like fallen Lucifer<br />
Wretched 'neath every sky; let the false rabble<br />
Change with the moon its despicable chiefs;<br />
Let the vain fop and goaded libertine<br />
Pick their poor pleasures, and adulterous spirits<br />
Pursue a phantom down the drifts of hell.<br />
But we will breathe the air that quickened us<br />
And see by this same light that gave us eyes,<br />
Here rooted where God sowed us, flowering here<br />
Where we have grown, making our constancy<br />
A pivot for this wheeling universe.<br />
Ah! 't is a fickle and unholy fondness<br />
Springs from caprice of will. Who doteth once<br />
May dote again, for who shall fetter fancy?<br />
As thou couldst bare thy breast to fortune's arrows<br />
Undaunted, for thy hope was all in God<br />
And life or death must crown it, so my bosom,<br />
Enshrining his good gifts, is satisfied<br />
And cannot speak again. Him heaven gave me<br />
Shall be my lord and my unchangeable love.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PALMERIN</span>. O constant lady! Let me then thank heaven,<br />
That graced me with the treasure of thy troth.<br />
Rejoice with me, my comrades. Say no more<br />
That time has parted us, and devious chances<br />
Governed our lives. How now, is this good Carl?<br />
And little Hugh, so grown? And thou, old gossip,<br />
Goes thy rheum better now the season warms?<br />
But where is Ulric?<br />

Each yet might climb to. But in thee declared<br />
Shine, Palmerin, the hopes of all the world.<br />
What God beheld and destined when he called thee<br />
Out of the void, he granted me to see<br />
First through the haze of maiden dreams and now<br />
With the deep glance of woman.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PALMERIN</span>. <span style="margin-left: 10em;">Then in sooth</span><br />
'T was no vain fancy, as the learned say,<br />
That made thy silent presence cross my path<br />
Where'er I turned, for if I slept my dream<br />
Painted thy smile, and when the vision fled<br />
The sunlit fountain met me with thy gaze.<br />
If the birds chirruped, it was <i>Flerida</i>,<br />
And <i>Flerida</i> if any minstrel sang.<br />
Thy mien was in the lilies, the thin clouds<br />
Contrived thy garments' fashion, and thy courage<br />
Breathed from the mountains to renew my soul.<br />
Nor was there need, for in these tables here<br />
Thy name, thy looks, thy words, thy noble ways<br />
Were graven deep, and, as the gaudy shadows<br />
Stalked by me which men take for beauteous thing,<br />
I laughed to scorn each feeble counterfeit,<br />
And cried to the sweet image in my soul<br />
How much more bright thou wast and beautiful.<br />
Little I thought the love that brought me blessing<br />
Brought sorrow here to thee.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FLERIDA</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">If it brought sorrow</span><br />
That grief was consecrate and offered up<br />
To aid thy noble venture. 'T was my hope<br />
That thy young sinews in a dreamless sleep<br />
Might knit them for the battle, while my vigils<br />
Kept trimmed thy spirit's lamp; so might thy valour,<br />
Fed on my sorrow's riches, greet the morn<br />
With more unsullied and resplendent rays<br />
Than her own shining, and the wondering world<br />
Should praise thy happy courage, little knowing<br />
The hidden might of love that nerved thy arm<br />
And taught thy blithe soul singing.<br />

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PALMERIN</span>. <span style="margin-left: 8em;">Flerida,</span><br />
Though I should give thee all ray life and blood,<br />

By what thou gavest first, and rendering all<br />
That should owe thee this sweet privilege<br />
Of having lived and loved thee.<br />

My father's sword was hanging by the wall:<br />
I drew the blade, and as he rushed to snatch it<br />
Transfixed his body; at my feet he fell<br />

And when the torment and the fever passed,<br />
For my poor strength had left some breath in him,<br />
Fettered and manacled they brought him forth<br />

Staining the hearthstone; and I spoke and said:<br />

<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PALMERIN</span>.  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">To be merciful</span><br />
Is to be truly just.&mdash;Has he not mended<br />
Or purged his sin in his captivity?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FLERIDA</span>. Indeed, it seems he has. Hugh and the friar<br />
Who daily visits him both bring report<br />
Of many pious and profound discourses<br />
With which he charms away his solitude.<br />
God grant his wisdom may outlive its cause<br />
And not forsake him now. For, see, he comes.<br />

<p class="parag">
<span style="margin-left: 8em;">What has chanced I know.</span><br />
'T were idle to rehearse that history.<br />
Only one matter, past my understanding,<br />
I ask thee to confess: how came thy soul<br />
To harbour thoughts so opposite to thine<br />
And do thy nobleness this injury?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ULRIC</span>. Alas! The saddest sorrow of the world<br />
Is not foul sin, but that resplendent virtue<br />
That yet brings evil on. 'T was nothing base,<br />
Hideous, ignoble, or contemptible<br />
That led me to my ruin, but the might<br />
Of perfect sweetness, joy unthinkable,<br />
And infinite deserts<i>;</i> it was the hunger<br />
For what most truly merits to be loved.<br />
'T was love, my lord, the love of Flerida<br />
Which, in thy bosom waking heaven's choirs,<br />
Brought hell into my breast. Was not her face<br />
As fair for me as thee to look upon?<br />
Was not her silver voice and high discourse<br />
Potent with reason on my listening ears?<br />
Why was it criminal in me to love<br />
And in thee lawful? For we both were men,<br />
And I the elder and the better born,<br />
Who might have wooed and won her worthily.<br />
Yet with no other crime than lucklessness,<br />
Because her father and her constant soul<br />
Lit first on thee, the tempest of my love<br />
Wrecked honour, faith, fame, life, and hope of heaven,<br />
Which, had the winds blown gently on my fortunes,<br />
The self-same love had blessed and glorified.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PALMERIN</span>. I pity thee; but summon not thy love<br />
To shield thy shame. Hadst thou been fortunate,<br />
Should I with cunning and outrageous hand<br />
Have moved against thy peace? Nay, by God's mercy,<br />
I should have gone my way, and patiently<br />
In other worlds have justified my soul;<br />
For sorrow more religiously than love<br />
Counselleth mortals.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ULRIC</span>. <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Ah, I loved too much.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PALMERIN</span>. Thou sayest well, Too much. Not that thy love<br />
In sweetness or in silent potency<br />
Of grief surpassed or mine or any man's.<br />
But finding in thy spirit no defence,<br />
Love fattened on thy reason, drank thy will,<br />
And quite consumed thy being; growing great,<br />
It left thee little, as, when a fiery wind<br />
Devours the stubble, both together perish<br />
And all goes out in shame. Water these ashes,<br />
Ulric, with warm and consecrated tears,<br />
That haply some new sweetness thence arise<br />
Beneath another heaven. Though thou leave us,<br />
Our hearts will not forget thee. In thy prayers<br />
Remember us, and use thy freedom well.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ULRIC</span>. I thank thee for thy counsel and thy mercy,<br />
Generous knight. Not comfortless I go,<br />
For not thy lips alone, well catechised,<br />
Forgive me, Palmerin: thy heart forgives.<br />
I would not use my freedom now to rove<br />
But to ascend. A cloister's little earth<br />
Is covered by the whole wide firmament.<br />
Being changed within, there let me live and die<br />
An anchorite, that I may outwardly<br />
Become a breathing symbol and a hand<br />
Pointing to heaven, become a lamp of love<br />
And keep my spirit's sacrificial flame<br />
Burning before the altar, till my blood,<br />
Its living oil, to light refine its fire<br />
And rise, by prayer transmuted, from this world.<br />
And at this parting let me bless thee, lady,<br />
Angel God chose to save me from my sin<br />
Even by tempting me. For in the storm<br />
And fury of my madness thy calm eyes<br />
That unaware had called me, as the moon<br />
Summons the leaping sea to follow her,<br />
Soon with quick bolt and soul-transfixing ire<br />
Awaked me from my dream. For who was I,<br />
That I should lift me to so pure a being<br />
Except in adoration, as the wave<br />
That mirrors in its slimy breast the glory<br />
Of some clear star, soon, grateful for that light,<br />
Sinks, moaning, to its restless element.<br />
So moaned I, in my dungeon's loneliness<br />
And in that larger solitude, the world,<br />
Where now no joy remained to beckon me.<br />
I cried to Nature, questioned sun and moon,<br />
At my cell's bars celestial visitants;<br />
Yes, I importuned my own soul to tell me<br />
Whether a man be born to look on good<br />
And straightway perish. Long I questioned fate.<br />
No answer came from heaven to my doubts;<br />
But with the Spring and the reviving note<br />
Of thrush and swallow, and the ploughman's song<br />
Heard from the fields, I somewhat calmed my griefs,<br />
And my heart took new counsel. Though a wave<br />
Mirror a star and sink into the sea,<br />
It cannot suffer; though the summer fade<br />
It shivers not at autumn; though the spheres<br />
Crash back to chaos they lament it not.<br />
Never the blasted deserts of the moon<br />
Mourned their lost verdure or implored reprieve.<br />
But my loud heart-beats, self-contemplative,<br />
Note their own weariness, and death foreknown<br />
Makes life a grim and halting agony.<br />
Yet something in me rides on circumstance<br />
And swims the tide of change. How should that die<br />
Which knows its dying, or that pine and fade<br />
Which marks the shrivelled leafage of the year?<br />
Can ashes choke that voice to lying silence<br />
Which once has said: I love? That truth must live<br />
Though unremembered, and that splendour shine<br />
Though all eyes close in sleep. When first I loved thee<br />
Something immortal darted through my flesh<br />
And made me godlike. Henceforth all of me<br />
That loved thee, all of thee my puissant love<br />
Hedging with worship rescued from the void<br />
Lives in eternity, a part of God,<br />
Who feeds with earth's unquenchable desire<br />
The skies' ethereal altar, to whose flame<br />
Passions are brands, thoughts smoke and frankincense,<br />
Nations and worlds unceasing hecatombs.<br />
There, growing one with all that ravished me,<br />
I also bum and never cease from love.<br />
Farewell, sweet lady. For thy pity thanks,<br />
More thanks for thy disdain, but for thy beauty<br />
Infinite thanks, for it was infinite<br />
And, while it blinded most, unsealed mine eyes.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FLERIDA</span>. Go in God's peace, and may he grant thee grace<br />
To see him always.<br />

<span style="margin-left: 8em;">Palmerin, this night</span><br />
Brings me a surfeit and a cloud of joys.<br />
I cannot seize them all. But many days<br />
Will suck their drop of sweetness from this store,<br />
And many silent nights and absences<br />
Feed on its garnered bliss.<br />
<br />

You 'll catch the ague and the chill of the fens,<br />

You 'll die before the wedding. Come along.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PALMERIN</span>. Sleep, Flerida, falls sweetly on a heart<br />
Freed from long doubt and anguish. Take thy rest.<br />
Palmerin watches at thy castle gates<br />
And all is well. Sleep, sleep, my Flerida.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FLERIDA</span>. Let me gaze long upon thee ere I go,<br />
Lest, waking, I believe that I have dreamt<br />
And weep anew and be disconsolate.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">PALMERIN</span>. Ah, were I only lying by thy side<br />
At the first checking of thy peaceful breath,<br />
To chase away that doubt before it grieved thee<br />
And with two kisses close thy dreamful eyes!<br />
Alas that we should meet to part, and love<br />
Only to be divided!<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FLERIDA</span>.  <span style="margin-left: 6em;">Palmerin,</span><br />
Though thou hast faced the world and conquered it,<br />
Thy noble heart is young. My briefer years<br />
And lonely life have farther traced the thread<br />
By which fate guides us through this labyrinth.<br />
To learn to part, to learn to be divided,<br />
We meet and love on earth; to learn to die<br />
Is the one triumph of the life of prayer.<br />
Shall love be but to hug the mother's breast,<br />
Or else run wailing? To prolong for ever<br />
The lovers' kiss, or pine for blandishments?<br />
Is the Lord's body but unleavened bread<br />
Weighed with a baker's measure, or his blood<br />
Wine to be drunk in bumpers? And shall love<br />
Be reckoned in embraces, and its grace<br />
Die with the taking of its sacrament?<br />
These be but symbols to the eye of time<br />
Of secrets written in eternity.<br />
The love that fed must wean the nourished soul,<br />
And through the dark and narrow vale of death<br />
Send forth the lover lone but panoplied.<br />
Else life were vain and love a moment's trouble<br />
That, passing, left untenanted the void,<br />
As summer winds a-tremble in this bower<br />
Might waft some fragrance from a rifled rose<br />
Through yonder gulf of night and nothingness.<br />
Hadst thou in battle fallen, were my soul<br />
Bereft of Palmerin? Or had I languished,<br />
Would Flerida have mocked thy constancy?<br />
Banish such thoughts, dear master of my being,<br />
From thy immortal soul. These fond enchantments<br />
Make the sweet holiday and youth of love;<br />
They are a largess and bright boon of heaven<br />
To sweeten our resolves. But youth will fade,<br />
And death, not mowing with a two-edged scythe,<br />
Will cut down one and leave the other bowing<br />
Before the wintry wind. Arm not with terror<br />
That swift, unheralded, insidious foe,<br />
But let him find our love invulnerable<br />
And our heart's treasure in eternal hands.<br />
My lord, good-night. To-day my joy is full,<br />
To God I leave to-morrow. Fare thee well.<br />
<br />

Yet this sad wight is he, as fairies know,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whom Flerida hath blest,</span><br />
Soon locked within her arms. She long ago<br />

<br />
Celestial Flerida, whom all the hours<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Adorning from her birth</span><br />
Have crowned the queen of stars, the queen of flowers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The queen of maids on earth.</span><br />

This vigil like the twilight life of earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then paradise at last</span><br />

And changeless love. How in the paling skies<br />

Open, heaven's gates! Eternal sun, arise!<br />

<br />
The muffled syllables that Nature speaks<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fill us with deeper longing for her word;</span><br />
She hides a meaning that the spirit seeks,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She makes a sweeter music than is heard.</span><br />
<br />
A hidden light illumines all our seeing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An unknown love enchants our solitude.</span><br />
We feel and know that from the depths of being<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Exhales an infinite, a perfect good.</span><br />
<br />
Though the heart wear the garment of its sorrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And be not happy like a naked star,</span><br />
Yet from the thought of peace some peace we borrow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some rapture from the rapture felt afar.</span><br />
<br />
Our heart strings are too coarse for Nature's fingers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To wake her purest melodies upon,</span><br />
And the harsh tremor that among them lingers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will into sweeter silence die anon.</span><br />
<br />
We catch the broken prelude and suggestion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of things unuttered, needing to be sung;</span><br />
We know the burden of them, and their question<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lies heavy on the heart, nor finds a tongue.</span><br />
<br />
Till haply, lightning through the storm of ages,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our sullen secret flash from sky to sky,</span><br />
Glowing in some diviner poet's pages<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And swelling into rapture from this sigh.</span><br />

I could believe that I am here alone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And all the world my dream;</span><br />
The passion of the scene is all my own,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And things that seem but seem.</span><br />
<br />
Perchance an exhalation of my sorrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hath raised this vaporous show,</span><br />
For whence but from my soul should all things borrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So deep a tinge of woe?</span><br />
<br />
I keep the secret doubt within my breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be the gods' defence,</span><br />
To ease the heart by too much ruth oppressed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And drive the horror hence.</span><br />
<br />
O sorrow that the patient brute should cower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And die, not having sinned!</span><br />
O pity that the wild and fragile flower<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should shiver in the wind!</span><br />
<br />
Then were I dreaming dreams I know not of,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For that is part of me</span><br />
That feels the piercing pang of grief and love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And doubts eternally.</span><br />
<br />
But whether all to me the vision come<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or break in many beams,</span><br />
The pageant ever shifts, and being's sum<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is but the sum of dreams.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
Lap, ripple, lap, Icarian wave, the sand<br />
Along the ruins of this piteous land;<br />
Murmur the praises of a lost delight,<br />
And soothe the aching of my starved sight<br />
With sheen of mirrored beauties, caught aright.<br />
<br />
Here stood enchanted palaces of old,<br />
All veined porphyry and burnished gold;<br />
Here matrons and slight maidens sat aloof<br />
Beneath cool porches, rich with Tyrian woof<br />
Hung from the carven rafters of the roof.<br />
<br />
Here in the mart a swarthy turbaned brave<br />
Showed the wrought blade or praised the naked slave.<br />
"Touch with your finger-tips this edge of steel,"<br />
Quoth he, "and see this lad, from head to heel<br />
Like a bronze Cupid. Feel, my masters, feel."<br />
<br />
Here Aphrodite filled with frenzied love<br />
The dark recesses of her murmurous grove.<br />
The doves that haunted it, the winds that sighed,<br />
Were souls of youths that in her coverts died,<br />
And hopes of heroes strewed her garden wide.<br />
<br />
Under her shades a narrow brazen gate<br />
Led to the courts of Ares and of Fate.<br />
Who entered breathed the unutterable prayer<br />
Of cruel hearts, and death was worshipped there,<br />
And men went thence enfranchised by despair.<br />
<br />
Here the proud athlete in the baths delayed,<br />
While a cool fountain on his shoulders played,<br />
Then in fine linen swathed his breast and thighs,<br />
And silent, myrtle-crowned, with serious eyes,<br />
Stepped forth to list the wranglings of the wise.<br />
<br />
A sage stalked by, his ragged mantle bound<br />
About his brows; his eyes perused the ground;<br />
He conned the number of the cube and square<br />
Of the moon's orb; his horny feet and bare<br />
Trampled the lilies carpeting the stair.<br />
<br />
A jasper terrace hung above the sea<br />
Where the King supped with his beloved three:<br />
The Libyan chanted of her native land<br />
In raucous melody, the Indian fanned,<br />
And the huge mastiff licked his master's hand.<br />
<br />
Below, alone, despairing of the gale,<br />
A crouching sailor furled the saffron sail;<br />
Then rose, breathed deep, and plunged in the lagoon.<br />
A mermaid spied his glistening limbs: her croon<br />
Enticed him down; her cold arms choked him soon.<br />
<br />
And the King laughed, filled full his jewelled bowl,<br />
And drinking cried: "What know we of the soul?<br />
What number addeth to her harmony<br />
These drops of vintage that attune her key,<br />
Or those of brine that set the wretched free?<br />
<br />
"If death should change me, as old fables feign,<br />
Into some slave or beast, to purge with pain<br />
My lordly pleasures, let my torment be<br />
Still to behold thee, Sybaris, and see<br />
The sacred horror of thy loves and thee.<br />
<br />
"Be thou my hell, my dumb eternal grief,<br />
But spare thy King the madness of belief,<br />
The brutish faith of ignorant desire<br />
That strives and wanders. Let the visible fire<br />
Of beauty torture me. That doom is higher.<br />
<br />
"I wear the crown of life. The rose and gem<br />
Twine with the pale gold of my diadem.<br />
Nature, long secret, hath unveiled to me<br />
And proved her vile. Her wanton bosoms be<br />
My pillow now. I know her, I am free."<br />
<br />
He spoke, and smiling stretched a languid hand,<br />
And music burst in mighty chords and bland<br />
Of harp and flute and cymbal.&mdash;When between<br />
Two cypresses the large moon rose, her sheen<br />
Silvered the nymphs' feet, tripping o'er the green.<br />
<br />

<br />
Again my feet are on the fragrant moor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Amid the purple uplands of Castile,</span><br />
Realm proudly desolate and nobly poor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Scorched by the sky's inexorable zeal.</span><br />
<br />
Wide desert where a diadem of towers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above Adajar hems a silent town,</span><br />
And locks, unmindful of the mocking hours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her twenty temples in a granite crown.</span><br />
<br />
The shafts of fervid light are in the sky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in my heart the mysteries of yore.</span><br />
Here the sad trophies of my spirit lie:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These dead fulfilled my destiny before.</span><br />
<br />
Like huge primeval stones that strew this plain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their nameless sorrows sink upon my breast,</span><br />
And like this ardent sky their cancelled pain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Smiles at my grief and quiets my unrest.</span><br />
<br />
For here hath mortal life from age to age<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Endured the silent hand that makes and mars,</span><br />
And, sighing, taken up its heritage<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the smiling and inhuman stars.</span><br />
<br />
Still o'er this town the crested castle stands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A nest for storks, as once for haughty souls;</span><br />
Still from the abbey, where the vale expands,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The curfew for the long departed tolls,</span><br />
<br />
Wafting some ghostly blessing to the heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From prayer of nun or silent Capuchin,</span><br />
To heal with balm of Golgotha the smart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of weary labour and distracted sin.</span><br />
<br />
What fate has cast me on a tide of time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Careless of joy and covetous of gold,</span><br />
What force compelled to weave the pensive rhyme<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When loves are mean, and faith and honour old,</span><br />
<br />
When riches crown in vain men's sordid lives,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And learning chokes a mind of base degree?</span><br />
What winged spirit rises from their hives?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What heart, revolting, ventures to be free?</span><br />
<br />
Their pride will sink and more ignobly fade<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Without memorial of its hectic fire.</span><br />
What altars shall survive them, where they prayed?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What lovely deities? What riven lyre?</span><br />
<br />
Tarry not, pilgrim, but with inward gaze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pass daily, musing, where their prisons are,</span><br />
And o'er the ocean of their babble raise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy voice in greeting to thy changeless star.</span><br />
<br />
Abroad a tumult, and a ruin here;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor world nor desert hath a home for thee.</span><br />
Out of the sorrows of the barren year<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Build thou thy dwelling in eternity.</span><br />
<br />
Let patience, faith's wise sister, be thy heaven,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with high thoughts necessity alloy.</span><br />
Love is enough, and love is ever given,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While fleeting days bring gift of fleeting joy.</span><br />
<br />
The little pleasures that to catch the sun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bubble a moment up from being's deep,</span><br />
The glittering sands of passion as they run,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The merry laughter and the happy sleep,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
These are the gems that, like the stars on fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Encrust with glory all our heaven's zones;</span><br />
Each shining atom, in itself entire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brightens the galaxy of sister stones,</span><br />
<br />
Dust of a world that crumbled when God's dream<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To throbbing pulses broke the life of things,</span><br />
And mingled with the void the scattered gleam<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of many orbs that move in many rings,</span><br />
<br />
Perchance at last into the parent sun<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To fall again and reunite their rays,</span><br />
When God awakes and gathers into one<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The light of all his loves and all his days.</span><br />

<br />
<br />
The buttress frowns, the gorgeous windows blaze,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The vault hangs wonderful with woven fans,</span><br />
The four stone sentinels to heaven raise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their heads, in a more constant faith than man':</span><br />
<br />
The College gathers, and the courtly prayer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is answered still by hymn and organ-groan;</span><br />
The beauty and the mystery are there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Virgin and Saint Nicholas are gone.</span><br />
<br />
Not one <i>Ora pro nobis</i> bids them pause<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In their far flight, to hear this anthem roll;</span><br />
No heart, of all that the King's relic awes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sings <i>Requiescat</i> to his mournful soul.</span><br />
<br />
No grain of incense thrown upon the embers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of their cold hearth, no lamp in witness hung</span><br />
Before their image. One alone remembers;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Only the stranger knows their mother tongue.</span><br />
<br />
Long rows of tapers light the people's places;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The little choristers may read, and mark</span><br />
The rhythmic fall; I see their wondering faces;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Only the altar&mdash;like the soul&mdash;is dark.</span><br />
<br />
Ye floating voices through these arches ringing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With measured music, subtle, sweet, and strong,</span><br />
Feel ye the inmost reason of your singing?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Know ye the ancient burden of your song?</span><br />
<br />
The twilight deepens, and the blood-dyed glories<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all these fiery blazonings are dim.</span><br />
Oh, they are jumbled, sad, forgotten stories!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why should ye read them, children? Chant your hymn.</span><br />
<br />
But I must con them while the rays of even<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kindle aloft some fading jewel-gleam</span><br />
And the vast windows glow a peopled heaven,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rich with the gathering pageant of my dream.</span><br />
<br />
Eden I see, where from the leafy cover<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The green-eyed snake begins to uncoil his length</span><br />
And whispers to the woman and her lover,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As they lie musing, large, in peaceful strength.</span><br />
<br />
I see their children, bent with toil and terror,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lurking in caves, or heaping madly on</span><br />
The stones of Babel, or the endless error<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Sodom, Nineveh, and Babylon.</span><br />
<br />
Here the Egyptian, wedding life with death,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flies from the sun into his painted tomb,</span><br />
And winds the secret of his antique faith<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tight in his shroud, and seals in sterile gloom.</span><br />
<br />
There the bold prophets of the heart's desire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hail the new Zion God shall build for them,</span><br />
And rapt Isaiah strikes the heavenly lyre,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Jeremiah mourns Jerusalem.</span><br />
<br />
Here David's daughter, full of grace and truth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Kneels in the temple, waiting for the Lord;</span><br />
With the first <i>Ave</i> comes the wingèd youth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bringing the lily ere he bring the sword.</span><br />
<br />
There, to behold the Mother and the Child,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sturdy shepherds down the mountain plod,</span><br />
And angels sing, with voices sweet and wild<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And wide lips parted: "Glory be to God."</span><br />
<br />
Here, mounted on an ass, the twain depart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To hallowed Egypt, safe from Herod's wrong;</span><br />
And Mary ponders all things in her heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pensive Joseph sadly walks along.</span><br />
<br />
There with the Twelve, before his blood is shed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Christ blesses bread and breaks it with his hands,</span><br />
"This is my body." Thomas shakes his head,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They marvel all, and no one understands,</span><br />
<br />
Save John, whom Jesus loved above the rest.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He marvels too, but, seeking naught beside,</span><br />
Leans, as his wont is, on his Master's breast.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah! the Lord's body also should abide.</span><br />
<br />
There Golgotha is dark against the blue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the broad east, above the painted crowd,</span><br />
And many look upon the sign, but few<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Read the hard lesson of the cross aloud.</span><br />
<br />
And from this altar, now an empty tomb,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Lord is risen. Lo! he is not here.</span><br />
No shining angel sitteth in the gloom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No Magdalen in anguish draweth near.</span><br />
<br />
All pure in heart, or all in aspect pure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The seemly Christians, kneeling, line the choir,</span><br />
And drop their eyelids, tender and demure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the low lingering harmonies expire.</span><br />
<br />
In that <i>Amen</i> are the last echoes blended<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all the ghostly world. The shades depart</span><br />
Into the sacred night. In peace is ended<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The long delirious fever of the heart.</span><br />
<br />
Then I go forth into the open wold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And breathe the vigour of the freshening wind,</span><br />
And with the piling drift of cloud I hold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A worship sweeter to the homeless mind,</span><br />
<br />
Where the squat willows with their osiers crowned<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Border the humble reaches of the Cam,</span><br />
And the deep meadows stretching far around<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Make me forget the exile that I am,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Exile not only from the wind-swept moor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where Guadarrama lifts his purple crest,</span><br />
But from the spirit's realm, celestial, sure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Goal of all hope and vision of the best.</span><br />
<br />
They also will go forth, these gentle youths,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Strong in the virtues of their manful isle,</span><br />
Till one the pathway of the forest smooths,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And one the Ganges rules, and one the Nile</span><br />
<br />
And to whatever wilderness they choose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their hearts will bear the sanctities of home,</span><br />
The perfect ardours of the Grecian Muse,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mighty labour of the arms of Rome;</span><br />
<br />
But, ah! how little of these storied walls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath whose shadow all their nurture was!</span><br />
No, not one passing memory recalls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Blessed Mary and Saint Nicholas.</span><br />
<br />
Unhappy King, look not upon these towers,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Remember not thine only work that grew.</span><br />
The moving world that feeds thy gift devours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the same hand that finished overthrew.</span><br />

<br />
BY MICHAEL ANGELO IN THE BARGELLO,<br />
<br />
CALLED AN APOLLO OR A DAVID<br />
<br />
<br />
What beauteous form beneath a marble veil<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Awaited in this block the Master's hand?</span><br />
Could not the magic of his art avail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To unseal that beauty's tomb and bid it stand?</span><br />
<br />
Alas! the torpid and unwilling mass<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Misknew the sweetness of the mind's control,</span><br />
And the quick shifting of the winds, alas!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Denied a body to that flickering soul.</span><br />
<br />
Fair homeless spirit, harbinger of bliss,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It wooed dead matter that they both might live,</span><br />
But dreamful earth still slumbered through the kiss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And missed the blessing heaven stooped to give,</span><br />
<br />
As when Endymion, locked in dullard sleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Endured the gaze of Dian, till she turned</span><br />
Stung with immortal wrath and doomed to weep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her maiden passion ignorantly spurned.</span><br />
<br />
How should the vision stay to guide the hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How should the holy thought and ardour stay,</span><br />
When the false deeps of all the soul are sand<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the loose rivets of the spirit clay?</span><br />
<br />
What chisel shaking in the pulse of lust<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall find the perfect line, immortal, pure?</span><br />
What fancy blown by every random gust<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall mount the breathless heavens and endure?</span><br />
<br />
Vain was the trance through which a thrill of joy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passed for the nonce, when a vague hand, unled,</span><br />
Half shaped the image of this lovely boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And caught the angel's garment as he fled.</span><br />
<br />
Leave, leave, distracted hand, the baffling stone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on that clay, thy fickle heart, begin.</span><br />
Mould first some steadfast virtue of thine own<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of the sodden substance of thy sin.</span><br />
<br />
They who wrought wonders by the Nile of old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bequeathing their immortal part to us,</span><br />
Cast their own spirit first into the mould<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And were themselves the rock they fashioned thus.</span><br />
<br />
Ever their docile and unwearied eye<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Traced the same ancient pageant to the grave,</span><br />
And awe made rich their spirit's husbandry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the perpetual refluence of its wave,</span><br />
<br />
Till 'twixt the desert and the constant Nile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sphinx, pyramid, and awful temple grew,</span><br />
And the vast gods, self-knowing, learned to smile<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the sky's unalterable blue.</span><br />
<br />
Long, long ere first the rapt Arcadian swain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heard Pan's wild music pulsing through the grove,</span><br />
His people's shepherds held paternal reign<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the large benignity of Jove.</span><br />
<br />
Long mused the Delphic sibyl in her cave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere mid his laurels she beheld the god,</span><br />
And Beauty rose a virgin from the wave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In lands the foot of Heracles had trod.</span><br />
<br />
Athena reared her consecrated wall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poseidon laid its rocky basement sure,</span><br />
When Theseus had the monstrous race in thrall<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And made the worship of his people pure.</span><br />
<br />
Long had the stripling stood in silence, veiled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hearing the heroes' legend o'er and o'er,</span><br />
Long in the keen palæstra striven, nor quailed<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To tame the body to the task it bore,</span><br />
<br />
Ere soul and body, shaped by patient art,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Walked linked with the gods, like friend with friend,</span><br />
And reason, mirrored in the sage's heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beheld her purpose and confessed her end.</span><br />
<br />
Mould, then, thyself and let the marble be.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Look not to frailty for immortal themes,</span><br />
Nor mock the travail of mortality<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With barren husks and harvesting of dreams.</span><br />

The dank earth reeks with three days' rain,<br />
The phantom trees are dark and still,<br />
Above the darkness and the hill<br />
The tardy moon shines out again.<br />
O heavy lethargy of pain!<br />
O shadows of forgotten ill!<br />
<br />
My parrot lips, when I was young,<br />
To prove and to disprove were bold.<br />
The mighty world has tied my tongue,<br />
And in dull custom growing old<br />
I leave the burning truth untold<br />
And the heart's anguish all unsung.<br />
<br />
Youth dies in man's benumbed soul,<br />
Maid bows to woman's broken life,<br />
A thousand leagues of silence roll<br />
Between the husband and the wife.<br />
The spirit faints with inward strife<br />
And lonely gazing at the pole.<br />
<br />
But how should reptiles pine for wings<br />
Or a parched desert know its dearth?<br />
Immortal is the soul that sings<br />
The sorrow of her mortal birth.<br />
O cruel beauty of the earth!<br />
O love's unutterable stings!<br />

<br />
<br />
Too late, thou tender songster of the sky<br />
Trilling unseen, by things unseen inspired,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">I list thy far-heard cry</span><br />
That poets oft to kindred song hath fired,<br />
As floating through the purple veils of air<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Thy soul is poured on high,</span><br />
A little joy in an immense despair.<br />
<br />
Too late thou biddest me escape the earth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">In ignorance of wrong</span><br />
To spin a little slender thread of song;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">On yet unwearied wing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To rise and soar and sing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Not knowing death or birth</span><br />
Or any true unhappy human thing.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To dwell 'twixt field and cloud,</span><br />
By river-willow and the murmurous sedge,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Be thy sweet privilege,</span><br />
To thee and to thy happy lords allowed.<br />
My native valley higher mountains hedge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">'Neath starlit skies and proud,</span><br />
And sadder music in my soul is loud.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Yet have I loved thy voice,</span><br />
Frail echo of some ancient sacred joy.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Ah, who might not rejoice</span><br />
Here to have wandered, a fair English boy,<br />
And breathed with life thy rapture and thy rest<br />
Where woven meadow-grasses fold thy nest?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">But whose life is his choice?</span><br />
And he who chooseth not hath chosen best.<br />

To cheer thy child in a disconsolate hour?<br />
Why do thy subtle hands betray their power<br />
And but half-fashioned leave thy finer clay?<br />
Upon what journeys doth thy fancy stray<br />
That weeds in thy broad garden choke the flower,<br />
And many a pilgrim harboured in thy bower<br />
A stranger came, a stranger went away?<br />
Ah, Mother, little can the soul avail<br />
Unchristened at some font of ancient love.<br />
What boots the vision if the meaning fail,<br />
When all the marvels of the skies above<br />
March to the passions they are mirrors of?<br />
If the heart pine, the very stars will pale.<br />

Behold Pelides with his yellow hair,<br />
Proud child of Thetis, hero loved of Jove;<br />
Above the frowning of his brows it wove<br />
A crown of gold, well combed, with Spartan care.<br />
Who might have seen him, sullen, great, and fair,<br />
As with the wrongful world he proudly strove,<br />
And by high deeds his wilder passion shrove,<br />
Mastering love, resentment, and despair.<br />
He knew his end, and Phoebus' arrow sure<br />
He braved for fame immortal and a friend,<br />
Despising life; and we, who know our end,<br />
Know that in our decay he shall endure<br />
And all our children's hearts to grief inure,<br />
With whose first bitter battles his shall blend.<br />

<br />
Who brought thee forth, immortal vision, who<br />
In Phthia or in Tempe brought thee forth?<br />
Out of the sunlight and the sapful earth<br />
What god the simples of thy spirit drew?<br />
A goddess rose from the green waves, and threw<br />
Her arms about a king, to give thee birth;<br />
A centaur, patron of thy boyish mirth,<br />
Over the meadows in thy footsteps flew.<br />
Now Thessaly forgets thee, and the deep<br />
Thy keeled bark furrowed answers not thy prayer<br />
But far away new generations keep<br />
Thy laurels fresh, where branching Isis hems<br />
The lawns of Oxford round about, or where<br />
Enchanted Eton sits by pleasant Thames.<br />
<br />

I gaze on thee as Phidias of old<br />
Or Polyclitus gazed, when first he saw<br />
These hard and shining limbs, without a flaw,<br />
And cast his wonder in heroic mould.<br />
Unhappy me who only may behold,<br />
Nor make immutable and fix in awe<br />
A fair immortal form no worm shall gnaw,<br />
A tempered mind whose faith was never told!<br />
The godlike mien, the lion's lock and eye,<br />
The well-knit sinew, utter a brave heart<br />
Better than many words that part by part<br />
Spell in strange symbols what serene and whole<br />
In nature lives, nor can in marble die.<br />

And amid ruins fed its flame apart,<br />
Heedless of shadows as they came and went.<br />
Till the poor soul, enticed by what she saw,<br />
Forsook her grief's eternal element,<br />
Filled with her tears a well from which to draw,<br />
And flooded heaven with a light she lent.<br />
A thousand times that mirrored glory fled,<br />
By ravished eyes a thousand times pursued;<br />
Yet loving hope outlived all beauties dead,<br />
And hunger turned the very stones to food.<br />

Indomitable hope or vain derision,<br />
Madness or revelation, sin or prayer,<br />

That he believe denying, and blaspheme<br />
Worshipping still, and drink eternal bliss<br />
Out of the maddening chalice of a dream?<br />

For æons had the self-responsive tide<br />
Risen to ebb, and tempests blown to clear,<br />
And the belated moon refilled her sphere<br />
To wane anew&mdash;for, æons since, she died&mdash;<br />
When to the deeps that called her earth replied<br />
(Lest year should cancel unavailing year)<br />
And took from her dead heart the stones to rear<br />
A cross-shaped temple to the Crucified.<br />
Then the wild winds through organ-pipes descended<br />
To utter what they meant eternally,<br />
And not in vain the moon devoutly mended<br />
Her wasted taper, lighting Calvary,<br />
While with a psalmody of angels blended<br />
The sullen diapason of the sea.<br />

O dweller in the valley, lift thine eyes<br />
To where, above the drift of cloud, the stone<br />
Endures in silence, and to God alone<br />
Upturns its furrowed visage, and is wise.<br />
There yet is being, far from all that dies,<br />
And beauty where no mortal maketh moan,<br />
Where larger planets swim the liquid zone,<br />
And wider spaces stretch to calmer skies.<br />
Only a little way above the plain<br />
Is snow eternal. Round the mountain's knees<br />
Hovers the fury of the wind and rain.<br />
Look up, and teach thy noble heart to cease<br />
From endless labour. There is perfect peace<br />
Only a little way above thy pain.<br />

That cries aloud in simple-hearted fear,<br />
Curses the villain, shudders at the fray,<br />
And weeps before the maiden's wreathed bier.<br />
Yet once familiar with the changeful show,<br />
He starts no longer at a brandished knife,<br />
But, his heart chastened at the sight of woe,<br />
Ponders the mirrored sorrows of his life.<br />
So tutored too, I watch the moving art<br />
Of all this magic and impassioned pain<br />
That tells the story of the human heart<br />
In a false instance, such as poets feign;<br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Not thankless for this gloom.</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I feel the blood again</span><br />
Coursing within my body's quickened house,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Feel hands and throat and brain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And dim thoughts growing plain,</span><br />
Or dreams of thoughts. So spring might thaw the boughs<br />
And from its winter's lethargy arouse<br />
An oak's numb spirit.&mdash;But hark! I seem to hear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A sound, like distant thunder.</span><br />
Above the quaking earth it breaks, or under,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And cracks the riven sphere.</span><br />
This vault is widened, I may lift my head,<br />
Behold a ray! The sun!&mdash;I was not dead.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE ANGEL OF ETERNITY</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Yes, dead. Be not affrighted.</span><br />
Ages have passed. This world is not the same.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Thy lamp of life, relighted,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Burns with a purer flame.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE SOUL</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">What lovely form art thou?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">What spirit, voice, or face</span><br />
Known and unknown? I cannot name thee now<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Nor the long-vanished place</span><br />
Where first I pledged thee some forgotten vow.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Dear mother or sweet son</span><br />
Or young love dead or lost familiar friend,<br />
Which of these all art thou, or all, or none,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Bright stranger, that dost bend</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Thy glorious golden head,</span><br />
A kindlier sun, above the wakened dead?<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE ANGEL</span><br />
<br />
We are not strangers. 'T is the world was strange,<br />
That rude antique parade of earth and sky,<br />
That foolish pageant of mortality<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And weary round of change.</span><br />
Till this glad moment thou hast lived in dreams,<br />
Nursed in a fable, catechised to croon<br />
The empty science of a sun and moon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That with their dubious beams</span><br />
Light the huge dusky stage of all that seems.<br />
Believe it not, my own. Awake, depart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Out of the shades of hell,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Trusting the sacred spell</span><br />
That falls upon thy strong perplexed heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The joy ineffable,</span><br />
The nameless premonition and dire pang<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of love. Be free at last,</span><br />
Free as the hopes that from thy sorrow sprang<br />
Forget the horror of the tyrant past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Forget the gods, forget</span><br />
The baleful shadow on the present cast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">By all that is not yet.</span><br />
Arise and follow me. Say not I seem<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">A shadow among shades,</span><br />
A dryad's laugh amid the windy glades,<br />
A swimmer's body guessed beneath the stream<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">This is the dawn of day,</span><br />
Thy dream-oppressed vision breaking through<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Its icy hood of clay</span><br />
And plunging deep into the balmy blue.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Bid thy vain cares adieu</span><br />
And say farewell to earth, thy foster-mother.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">She hath befooled thee long,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And fondly thought to smother</span><br />
The sweet and cruel laughter of my song<br />
Which the stars sing together, and the throng<br />
Of seraphs ever shout to one another.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Come, heaven-chosen brother,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Dear kinsman, come along.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE SOUL</span><br />
<br />
To what fields beside what rivers<br />
Dost thou beckon me, fair love?<br />
With no sprinkled stars above<br />
Is high heaven seen? Or quivers,<br />
With no changes of the moon,<br />
Her bright path athwart the pool?<br />
Is thy strange world beautiful?<br />
Tell me true, before I shake<br />
From my sense this heavy swoon.<br />
Tell me true, lest I awake<br />
Into deeper dreams, poor fool,<br />
And rejoice for nothing's sake.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE ANGEL</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For mortals life and truth</span><br />
Are things apart, nor when the first is done<br />
Know they the other; for their lusty youth<br />
Is madness, and their age oblivion.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But henceforth thou art one</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With the supernal mind,</span><br />
Not born in labour nor in death resigned,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The life of all that live,</span><br />
The light by whose eclipse the world is blind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The truth of all that know,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The joy for which we grieve,</span><br />
And the untasted sweet that makes our woe.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Now thou hast drained the wine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Shatter the glass.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The music was divine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Let the voice pass.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Linger not in the host</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Of the long lost</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Bidding the dying bring</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Meal-cakes and fruit, and sing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">To cheer thy ghost.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But be the living joy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">That tunes all song,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The loves of girl and boy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The hopes that throng</span><br />
The unconquerable heart, defying wrong.<br />
Seek for thine immortality of bliss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Not other brighter skies</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Or later worlds than this,</span><br />
But all that in this struggle is the prize,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The love that wings the kiss,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The truth the visions miss.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE SOUL</span><br />
<br />
My heaven lives, bright angel, in thine eyes.<br />
As when, beside the Lake of Galilee,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">John, o'er his meshes bent,</span><br />
Looked up, and saw another firmament<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">When God said, Follow me;</span><br />
So is my world transfigured, seeing thee,<br />
And, looking in thine eyes, I am content,<br />
And with thy sweet voice for all argument<br />
I leave my tangled nets beside the sea.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Done is my feigned task,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Fallen the mask</span><br />
That made me other, O my soul, than thee.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">I have fulfilled my pain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And borne my cross,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">And my great gain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Is to have known my loss.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Keep, blessed vision, keep</span><br />
The sacred beauty that entranced my soul.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">I have read; seal the scroll.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">I have lived; let me sleep.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE ANGEL</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Behold, I close thine eyes</span><br />
With the first touch of my benignant hands.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With consecrated brands</span><br />
I light thy pyre and loose thy spirit's bands.<br />
The eternal gods receive thy sacrifice,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The changeless bless thy embers.</span><br />
May there arise from thence no wailing ghost<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That shivers and remembers</span><br />
The haunts he loved, where he hath suffered most.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The life that lived by change</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Is dead, nor changeth more.</span><br />
No eager, dull, oblivious senses pore<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">On portents dark and strange.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Thy first life was not life,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Nor was thy first death death.</span><br />
Thy children took thy heritage of strife,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And thy transmutable breath</span><br />
Passed to another heart that travaileth.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Now thou hast truly died;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Escaped, renounced, defied</span><br />
The insensate fervour and the fret of being;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And thy own master, freed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">From shame of murderous need,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Pure, just, all-seeing,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Now thou shalt live indeed.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE SOUL</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I pay the price of birth.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">My earth returns to earth.</span><br />
Hurry my ashes, thou avenging wind,<br />
Into the vortex of the whirling spheres!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I die, for I have sinned,</span><br />
Yea, I have loved, and drained my heart of tears.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And thou within whose womb,</span><br />
Mother of nations, labouring Universe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">My life grew, be its tomb.</span><br />
Thou brought'st me forth, take now my vital seed.<br />
Receive thy wage, thou iron-hearted nurse,<br />
Thy blessing I requite thee and thy curse.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Now shall my ashes breed</span><br />
Within thy flesh for every thought a thought,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For every deed a deed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For every pang I bore</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">An everlasting need,</span><br />
For every wrong a wrong, and endless war.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">All earthly hopes resigned</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And all thy battle's spoils</span><br />
I lay upon thine altar and restore;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But the inviolate mind</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Is loosened from thy toils</span><br />
By thy own fatal fires. I mount, I soar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Glad Phoenix, from the flame</span><br />
Into the placid heaven whence I came,<br />
Floating upon the smoke's slow lurid wings<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Into my native sky</span><br />
To bear report of all this vanity<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And sad offence of things,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where with knowledge I may lie,</span><br />
Veiled in the shadow of eternal wings.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE ANGEL</span><br />
<br />
If in the secret sessions of our love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Above the heavenly spheres,</span><br />
Some stain upon the page of wisdom prove<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Her earthly price of tears,</span><br />
Cling closer, my beloved, that the beat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of my unruffled heart</span><br />
May tune thy own, its tenderer counterpart,<br />
To noble courage, and from this high seat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of our divine repose</span><br />
Large consolation flow to mortal woes.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">For 'neath the sun's fierce heat,</span><br />
In midst of madness and inscrutable throes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">His heart is strong who knows</span><br />
That o'er the mountains come the silent feet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of Patience, leading Peace,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And his complainings cease</span><br />
To see the starlight shining on the snows.<br />

<br />
<i>"Non so se s'è la desiata luce"</i><br />
<br />
<br />
I know not if from uncreated spheres<br />
Some longed-for ray it be that warms my breast,<br />
Or lesser light, in memory expressed,<br />
Of some once lovely face, that reappears,<br />
Or passing rumour ringing in my ears,<br />
Or dreamy vision, once my bosom's guest,<br />
That left behind I know not what unrest,<br />
Haply the reason of these wayward tears.<br />
But what I feel and seek, what leads me on,<br />
Comes not of me; nor can I tell aright<br />
Where shines the hidden star that sheds this light.<br />
Since I beheld thee, sweet and bitter fight<br />
Within me. Resolution have I none.<br />
Can this be, Master, what thine eyes have done?<br />
<br />

<br />
<i>"Il mio refugio</i>"<br />
<br />
<br />
The haven and last refuge of my pain<br />
(A strong and safe defence)<br />
Are tears and supplications, but in vain.<br />
Love sets upon me banded with Disdain,<br />
One armed with pity and one armed with death,<br />
And as death smites me, pity lends me breath.<br />
Else had my soul long since departed thence.<br />
She pineth to remove<br />
Whither her hopes of endless peace abide<br />
And beauty dwelleth without beauty's pride,<br />
There her last bliss to prove.<br />
But still the living fountain of my tears<br />
Wells in the heart when all thy truth appears,<br />
Lest death should vanquish love.<br />

"<i>Gli occhi miei vaghi delle cose belle</i>"<br />
<br />
<br />
Ravished by all that to the eyes is fair,<br />
Yet hungry for the joys that truly bless,<br />
My soul can find no stair<br />
To mount to heaven, save earth's loveliness.<br />
For from the stars above<br />
Descends a glorious light<br />
That lifts our longing to their highest height<br />
And bears the name of love.<br />
Nor is there aught can move<br />
A gentle heart, or purge or make it wise,<br />
But beauty and the starlight of her eyes.<br />

<br />
<br />
SOUVENIR<br />
<br />
<br />
I weep, but with no bitterness I weep,<br />
To look again upon thee, hallowed spot,<br />
O dearest grave, and most of men forgot,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where buried love doth sleep.</span><br />
<br />
What witchcraft think you that this desert hath,<br />
Dear friends, who take my hand and bid me stay,<br />
Now that the gentle wont of many a day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Would lead me down this path?</span><br />
<br />
Here are the wooded slopes, the flowering heath,<br />
The silver footprints on the silent sand,<br />
The loitering lanes, alive with lovers' breath,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where first I kissed her hand.</span><br />
<br />
I know these fir-trees, and this mossy stone,<br />
And this deep gorge, and all its winding ways;<br />
These friendly giants, whose primeval moan<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Hath rocked my happy days.</span><br />
<br />
My footsteps' echo in this tangled tree<br />
Gives back youth's music, like a singing bird;<br />
Dear haunts, fair wilderness her presence stirred,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Did you not watch for me?</span><br />
<br />
I will not dry these tear-drops: let them flow,<br />
And soothe a bitterness that yet might last,<br />
And o'er my waking-weary eyelids throw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The shadow of the past.</span><br />
<br />
My useless plainings shall not make to cease<br />
The happy echoes of the vows we vowed:<br />
Proud is this forest in its noble peace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And my heart too is proud.</span><br />
<br />
Give o'er to hopeless grief the bitter hours<br />
You kneel to pray upon a brother's tomb:<br />
Here blows the breath of love, and graveyard flowers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Not in this garden bloom.</span><br />
<br />
See! The moon rides athwart a bank of cloud.<br />
Thy veils, fair Queen of Night, still cling to thee,<br />
But soon thou loosenest thy virgin shroud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And smilest to be free.</span><br />
<br />
As the rich earth, still dank with April rain,<br />
Beneath thy rays exhales day's captive balm,<br />
So from my purged soul, as pure, as calm,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The old love breathes again.</span><br />
<br />
Where are they gone, those ghosts of sorrow pale,<br />
Where fled the passion that my heart defiled?<br />
Once in the bosom of this friendly vale<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I am again a child.</span><br />
<br />
O  might of time, O changes of the year,<br />
Ye undo sorrow and the tears we shed,<br />
But, touched with pity, on our blossoms sere<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Your light feet never tread.</span><br />
<br />
Heavenly solace, be for ever blest!<br />
I had not thought a sword could pierce so far<br />
Into the heart, and leave upon the breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">So sweet and dear a scar.</span><br />
<br />
Far from me the sharp word, the thankless mind,<br />
Of vulgar sorrow customary weed,<br />
Shroud that about the corse of love they wind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Who never loved indeed.</span><br />
<br />
Why, Dante, dost thou say the saddest curse<br />
Is joy remembered in unhappy days?<br />
What grief compelled thee to this bitter verse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In sorrow's harsh dispraise?</span><br />
<br />
O'er all the worlds is light bereft of gladness<br />
When sad eclipses cast their blight on us?<br />
Did thy great soul, in its immortal sadness,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Speak to thee, Dante, thus?</span><br />
<br />
No, by this sacred light upon me cast!<br />
Not in thy heart this blasphemy had birth.<br />
It is the truest happiness on earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To have a happy past.</span><br />
<br />
What! When the soul forlorn finds yet a spark<br />
Mid the hot ashes of her stifled sighs,<br />
And doth that flame, her only treasure, mark<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With captivated eyes,</span><br />
<br />
Bathing her wounds in the delicious past<br />
That mirrors brokenly her loves again,<br />
Thy cruel word her feeble joy would blast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And turn to bitter pain?</span><br />
<br />
And couldst thou wrong thine own Francesca so,<br />
Wrong thy bright angel with a word like this,<br />
Her whose lips, parting to rehearse her woe,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Broke an eternal kiss?</span><br />
<br />
What, righteous Heaven, is our human thought,<br />
And to the love of truth who yet will cling,<br />
If every pain or joy e'er shunned or sought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Turns to a doubtful thing?</span><br />
<br />
How can you live, strange souls that nothing awes?<br />
In midst of haste and passion, song and mirth,<br />
Nor all the stars of heaven give you pause,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Nor all the sins of earth;</span><br />
<br />
But when upon your fated way you meet<br />
Some dumb memorial of a passion dead,<br />
That little pebble stops you, and you dread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To bruise your tender feet.</span><br />
<br />
You cry aloud that life is but a dream,<br />
And, to the truth awaking, wring your hands,<br />
And grieve your bubble but a moment stands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Upon time's foaming stream.</span><br />
<br />
Poor fools! That moment when your soul could shake<br />
The numbing fetters off that it enthrall,<br />
That fleeting moment was your all in all&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Oh, mourn not for its sake!</span><br />
<br />
But rather mourn your weight of earthly dross,<br />
Your joyless toil, your stains of blood and mire,<br />
Your sunless days, your nights without desire;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In these was utter loss.</span><br />
<br />
What profit have you of your late lament,<br />
And what from heaven do your murmurs crave,<br />
The plaints you sow upon the barren grave<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Of every pleasure spent?</span><br />
<br />
Life is a dream, and all things pass, I know:<br />
If some fair splendour we be charmed withal,<br />
We pluck the flower, and at the breath we blow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Its withered petals fall.</span><br />
<br />
Ay, the first kiss and the first virgin vow<br />
That ever mortals upon earth did swear,<br />
That whirlwind caught which strips the frozen bough<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And stones to sand doth wear.</span><br />
<br />
A witness to the lovers' troth was night,<br />
With changeful skies, o'ercast with mystery,<br />
And stars unnumbered, that an inward light<br />
Devours unceasingly.<br />
<br />
They saw death hush the song bird in the glade,<br />
Blast the pale flower, and freeze the torpid worm,<br />
And choke the fountain where the image played<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3.5em;">Of their forgotten form.</span><br />
<br />
Yet they joined hands above the mouldering clod,<br />
Blind with love's light that flashed across the sky,<br />
Nor felt the cold eye of the changeless God<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Who watches all things die.</span><br />
<br />
Fools! says the sage: thrice blest! the poet says.<br />
What wretched joy is to the faint heart dear<br />
Whom noise of torrents fills with weak amaze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And the wind fills with fear?</span><br />
<br />
I have seen beneath the sun more beauties fail<br />
Than white sea foam or leaves of forest sere;<br />
More than the swallows and the roses frail<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Desert the widowed year.</span><br />
<br />
Mine eyes have gazed on sights of deeper woe<br />
Than Juliet dead within the gorged tomb,<br />
And deadlier than the cup that Romeo<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Drank to his love and doom.</span><br />
<br />
I have seen my love, when all I loved had perished,<br />
Who to a whited sepulchre is turned;<br />
Seen the thin dust of all I ever cherished<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">In her cold heart inurned,&mdash;</span><br />
<br />
Dust of that faith which, in our bosoms furled,<br />
The gentle night had warded well from doubt.<br />
More than a single life, alas! a world<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Was that day blotted out.</span><br />
<br />
Still young I found her, and, men said, more fair;<br />
In heaven's light her eyes could still rejoice,<br />
And her lips opened, and a smile was there,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And sound as of a voice.</span><br />
<br />
But not that gentle voice, that tender grace,<br />
Those eyes I worshipped when they looked their prayer:<br />
My heart, still full of her, searched, searched her face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And could not find her there.</span><br />
<br />
And still I could have gone to her, and cast<br />
My arms about that chill and lifeless stone,<br />
And cried, Where hast thou left it, faithless one,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Where hast thou left the past?</span><br />
<br />
But no: it rather seemed as if by chance<br />
Some unknown woman had that voice and eye<i>;</i><br />
I looked up into heaven; with cold glance<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I passed that statue by.</span><br />
<br />
Not without pangs of shame and bitterness<br />
I watched her smiling shadow glide away;<br />
But what of that? Immortal nature, say,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Have I loved therefore less?</span><br />
<br />
On me the gods may now their lightnings fling,<br />
They cannot undo truth, nor kill the past.<br />
Like a wrecked sailor to a broken mast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To my dead love I cling.</span><br />
<br />
I make no question of what flowers may bloom,<br />
What virtue from the seasons man may borrow,<br />
What heavenly lamp may flood with light to-morrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The vault of this great tomb.</span><br />
<br />
I only say: Here at this hour, one day,<br />
I loved, and I was loved, and she was fair.<br />
This treasure which no death can filch away<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">My soul to God shall bear.</span><br />

<br />
All things are doubly fair<br />
If patience fashion them<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And care&mdash;</span><br />
Verse, enamel, marble, gem.<br />
<br />
No idle chains endure:<br />
Yet, Muse, to walk aright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Lace tight</span><br />
Thy buskin proud and sure.<br />
<br />
Fie on a facile measure,<br />
A shoe where every lout<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">At pleasure</span><br />
Slips his foot in and out!<br />
<br />
Sculptor, lay by the clay<br />
On which thy nerveless finger<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">May linger,</span><br />
Thy thoughts flown far away.<br />
<br />
Keep to Carrara rare,<br />
Struggle with Paros cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That hold</span><br />
The subtle line and fair.<br />
<br />
Lest haply nature lose<br />
That proud, that perfect line,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Make thine</span><br />
The bronze of Syracuse.<br />
<br />
And with a tender dread<br />
Upon an agate's face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Retrace</span><br />
Apollo's golden head.<br />
<br />
Despise a watery hue<br />
And tints that soon expire.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With fire</span><br />
Burn thine enamel true.<br />
<br />
Twine, twine in artful wise<br />
The blue-green mermaid's arms,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Mid charms</span><br />
Of thousand heraldries.<br />
<br />
Show in their triple lobe<br />
Virgin and Child, that hold<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Their globe,</span><br />
Cross-crowned and aureoled.<br />
<br />
All things return to dust<br />
Save beauties fashioned well.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The bust</span><br />
Outlasts the citadel.<br />
<br />
Oft doth the ploughman's heel,<br />
Breaking an ancient clod,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Reveal</span><br />
A Cæsar or a god.<br />
<br />
The gods, too, die, alas!<br />
But deathless and more strong<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Than brass</span><br />
Remains the sovereign song.<br />
<br />
Chisel and carve and file,<br />
Till thy vague dream imprint<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Its smile</span><br />
On the unyielding flint.<br />

<br />
Fair Harvard, the winter of Puritan snows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That enshrouded thy tremulous birth</span><br />
Melts slowly to spring, now the south wind blows<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er the face of this generous earth.</span><br />
<br />
Thy elms are outspreading their flexible arms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over meadows more fruitful and broad,</span><br />
And soft ivy is veiling with negligent charms<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The gaunt walls of the castle of God.</span><br />
<br />
With freedom for heritage, reason for star,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And friendship for sojourner here,</span><br />
Shall music long tremblingly sound from afar<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or genius be smothered in fear?</span><br />
<br />
Where the ages may meet and the spirit may climb<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To a truth that is builded on doubt,</span><br />
The eternal may dwell mid the currents of time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And peace above barbarous rout,</span><br />
<br />
And the just voice unlearn to be strident and sharp,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, attuned to life's happier choir,</span><br />
Join the stress of all David might shout to his harp<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With all Lysis might lisp to his lyre,</span><br />
<br />
And Olympia again call the strong and the fleet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To glory and art and control,</span><br />
And a deathless Academy build a retreat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To ponder the things of the soul.</span><br />
<br />
If to glory, young Mother, thy destiny tend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If thy labours have honour in store,</span><br />
Our loves shall not die, though their chronicle end<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor mortals remember us more.</span><br />
<br />
For once from their dreaming the man and the boy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fair Harvard, awoke at thy name,</span><br />
And our happiest years were a part of thy joy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our light was a spark of thy flame.</span><br />

<br />
As we say good-bye at the parting ways,<br />
Let us sing together a song of praise,<br />
Let us drink a toast to our college days,<br />
To the walks through a world made for you and me,<br />
To the boisterous farce and the echoing glee,<br />
To the wonderful A and the dreadful E,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Drink, boys, drink!</span><br />
<br />
To the games we won and the games we lost,<br />
For we could n't tell which before we tossed,<br />
And who cares now who paid the cost?<br />
To the woman's love that came and went,<br />
To the good wine drunk and the money spent,<br />
To the night-long foolish argument,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Drink, boys, drink!</span><br />
<br />
To the times when men were men indeed,<br />
To our fathers' youth and our mothers' creed,<br />
And to every faith that may succeed,<br />
To the after age and the later tongue<br />
That will ring the changes we have rung<br />
And sing the songs we have left unsung,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Drink, boys, drink!</span><br />
<br />
When the eye is dull and the hand is cold,<br />
Then should the pocket be full of gold,<br />
For no one will love us when we 're old.<br />
So to vulgar gold and what it gets<br />
And an honest end to all our debts,<br />
For an old wine softens old regrets,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Drink, boys, drink!</span><br />
<br />
When we are asleep beneath grey stone,<br />
Our children's lives shall repeat our own,<br />
For the light remains though the days be flown.<br />
To the opening buds of this ended May,<br />
And to all sweet things that will not stay,<br />
And to every dog that has had his day,<br />

<br />
Twelve had struck. Our talk subsided.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We were comrades in the schools</span><br />
By the world awhile divided&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Six sententious merry fools.</span><br />
And I said, "We 've talked of college,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Resurrecting callow youth.</span><br />
But you since have lived; what knowledge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Have you gathered of the Truth?</span><br />
And you first, most learned scholar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whom I 'm proud to sit beside,</span><br />
Speak: does wisdom sans a dollar<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Leave you wholly satisfied?</span><br />
You have walked, and never wavered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the paths the sages took</span><br />
And three publishers have favoured<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With a yet unpublished book.</span><br />
The soul's garden you have weeded<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which we mortals trample through,</span><br />
You love much we leave unheeded.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Speak, and let us learn of you."</span><br />
And the student thus proceeded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As a gentle sigh he drew:</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE SCHOLAR</span><br />
<br />
I'm thankful that as matters go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I neither toil nor spin,</span><br />
But read the good old wits, heigh ho!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And live with elder kin;</span><br />
<br />
That I need neither reap nor sow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor gather into barns,</span><br />
But dwell among my books, heigh ho!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Repeating ancient yarns.</span><br />
<br />
Dead things are not my science, no,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor fossil parts of speech,</span><br />
But the great human heart, heigh ho!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That pedants never reach.</span><br />
<br />
The record of man's joy and woe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon his sculptured face</span><br />
I read by my heart's light, heigh ho!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And vanquish time and space.</span><br />
<br />
I find no vice so foul and low<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But nature lurks therein,</span><br />
Nor any thought so high, heigh ho!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But pays the price of sin.</span><br />
<br />
I feel the pity and the glow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of truth's sublime communion,</span><br />
And learn to smile at fate, heigh ho!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In friendship's happy union.</span><br />
<br />
Let this but last till death's wind blow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And till my bones are rotten,</span><br />
Then let the world sail on, heigh ho!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And be ray name forgotten.</span><br />
<br />
"Now you, votary of pleasure,"<br />
Turning to the next, I said,<br />
"Count the profit of your leisure<br />
And the cost of unearned bread.<br />
Tell us what civilisation<br />
Merits your impartial praise,<br />
In what climate, in what nation<br />
You have spent most joyous days."<br />
Quoth he, as if in admiration<br />
That such questions I should raise:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE SPORT</span><br />
<br />
All things are nice when they are new,<br />
When they are old, all things are horrid.<br />
After the storm I like the blue,<br />
After the arctic zone the torrid.<br />
My loves are many, brief, and true,<br />
By mutual jealousy unworried.<br />
<br />
I like to leave my house and home<br />
And cross the mountains and the sea;<br />
With one small bag on earth to roam,<br />
That is the height of bliss for me.<br />
To roam on earth without my bag,<br />
That is the depth of misery.<br />
<br />
That freedom cheats us with a word<br />
Which sets up knaves and murders kings.<br />
What soul is free that never stirred?<br />
Go cut your mother's apron-strings,<br />
And putting money in your purse,<br />
Fly off on the express-train's wings.<br />
<br />
I'll stay at home when I am lame,<br />
And build a church when stuffed with gold,<br />
I will be grave when known to fame,<br />
I will be chaste when I am old.<br />
Then all the angels will rejoice<br />
That I, lost lamb, regain the fold.<br />
<br />
"Without some evil, nothing good,"<br />
Your subtle theologians say.<br />
I glorify their rectitude<br />
By straying in my artless way.<br />
My needful sins make possible<br />
The higher morals of the day.<br />
<br />
This is our only chance to taste<br />
The sweet and bitter fruits of earth.<br />
To pluck them all, we've need of haste;<br />
We cannot ask what each is worth.<br />
Up, up, wise virgin; do not waste<br />
The little time 'twixt death and birth.<br />
<br />
Come feel the joy of changing skies,<br />
Of rushing streams and windy weather.<br />
Though we be bound by fortune's ties,<br />
We' 11 to the utmost stretch the tether,<br />
And be they gay or be they sad,<br />
We'll go and see the sights together.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE CRITIC</span><br />
<br />
"Shall men agree?" the next man said,<br />
"Each mind is shut within some head<br />
(<i>Pace</i> the minds of all the dead)<br />
With two eyes, seldom of a size,<br />
And spectacles before the eyes.<br />
Then, if men differ, what surprise?<br />
<br />
"See the wight who wrapped in sadness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grieves how soon this life is done,</span><br />
And, disgusted with the madness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the way the world is run,</span><br />
Scorns the hollowness of gladness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the idiocy of fun:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why, the spots upon the sun</span><br />
Can be seen, when the ray passes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Blue eye-glasses.</span><br />
<br />
"And what makes the moonlight shimmer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the dancing of the sea</span><br />
And the little stars cold glimmer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Twinkle with an inward glee</span><br />
While this working-world grows dimmer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If my Mary looks with me?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not the moon or stars or sea,</span><br />
But the fickle cause, alas, is<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Love's eye-glasses.</span><br />
<br />
"Oh, how sad a world to cough in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is a world once warm and fair,</span><br />
And how many fallings off in<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Old men's world of falling hair,</span><br />
Till they think within the coffin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That there's no world anywhere.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For I fancy dead men wear</span><br />
(Take your look now, lads and lasses!)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">No eye-glasses."</span><br />
<br />
He stopped, and with a civil look<br />
Said to his neighbour, "You come next,"<br />
Who had been looking at a book<br />
And seemed a trifle bored and vexed.<br />
He laid the book down, stretched his legs<br />
And yawned, and, emptying his glass,<br />
Made a grimace as if the dregs<br />
Were bitter, and replied, "I pass."<br />
When pressed, he shook his languid head<br />
Until at last he hemmed and said:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE PESSIMIST</span><br />
<br />
I set my heart on being good,<br />
Believed the Bible to the letter,<br />
Yes, joined a Christian brotherhood<br />
When I was young and knew no better;<br />
And, if I sometimes sinned, I wept<br />
That God's commandments were not kept.<br />
As time went on, I understood<br />
That it was wrong to be so good.<br />
<br />
My heart I set on being wise<br />
And passing for a clever fellow:<br />
Reading o' nights I spoilt my eyes,<br />
And lack of fresh air turned me yellow.<br />
Each book I read said t' other lied,<br />
I saw the less the more I pried,<br />
And so I found, to my surprise,<br />
I was a fool to be so wise.<br />
<br />
I set my heart on making friends<br />
Pleasant and clever, kind and witty;<br />
They now are at the earth's four ends,<br />
Two only have n't left the city.<br />
The one is given up to trade,<br />
The other in the churchyard laid.<br />
And when youth's gone and leisure ends,<br />
It is too late for making friends.<br />
<br />
I set my heart upon a girl<br />
Who chose at my approach to smile.<br />
Did she but pat some frizzled curl,<br />
I knew the angel free from guile.<br />
But now a rich man owns my belle,<br />
I find the others smile as well,<br />
And my moustache no more I twirl,<br />
Nor set my heart upon a girl.<br />
<br />
I set my heart on seeing things,<br />
And wished through every land to travel,<br />
See Troja's ruins, Nikis' springs,<br />
And culture's history unravel.<br />
When many a sea had made me sick,<br />
Men still were bipeds, houses brick.<br />
Since nearer Truth no journey brings<br />
I make an end of seeing things.<br />
<br />
I set my heart on politics;<br />
I glowed for honesty and freedom.<br />
My earnest thoughts I tried to fix<br />
Upon the poor, and how to feed 'em.<br />
But the reformer cheats himself,<br />
He serves his prejudice or pelf,<br />
And no man's will but inward fate<br />
Governs the fortunes of the state.<br />
<br />
I set my heart on nothing now,<br />
But bless the gifts of every hour,<br />
Holding my hand beneath life's bough<br />
To catch the fruit or falling flower.<br />
With the world breathing at my feet,<br />
I find the sunset stillness sweet,<br />
And with the night wind on my brow<br />
I set my heart on nothing now.<br />
<br />
He scarce had done, when the last man,<br />
Who'd listened hard to every word,<br />
Thus, rising in his place, began<br />
As if impatient to be heard:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE LOVER</span><br />
<br />
Oh, you men who are not married<br />
Have n't known the joy of living,<br />
On the margin you have tarried,<br />
Never putting out to sea;<br />
All your musing, all your grieving,<br />
Is a childish thing to me.<br />
<br />
I have done with idle moping<br />
And have seen my manly duty.<br />
There is no more doubt and groping,<br />
Since I took a woman's hand,<br />
And the loadstar of her beauty<br />
Led me to the promised land.<br />
<br />
For her sake my work is pleasure<br />
And I thrive in my devotion,<br />
Though I seek repute and treasure<br />
But to have the gifts to give,<br />
For my love, like River Ocean,<br />
Rounds the world in which I live.<br />
<br />
When I feel, in softest slumber,<br />
Her fair head upon my pillow,<br />
I think how the misty Humber<br />
And the Ganges' holy stream<br />
Send their treasures o'er the billow<br />
To embalm my lady's dream.<br />
<br />
Rightly did my father rear me<br />
Close beside the village steeple,<br />
Rightly shall my sons revere me<br />
When they come to take my place,<br />
For I serve my land and people<br />
And maintain my sturdy race.<br />
<br />
Fill your glasses up with liquor,<br />
Drink it down while yet it bubbles.<br />
When the heart beats quick and quicker<br />
Love is knocking. Drink with me:<br />
Here is death to all your troubles,<br />
And long life, fair love, to thee!<br />
<br />
"Yes, fill your glasses up, I pray you,"<br />
Said I, "and make it bumpers now,<br />
For whatsoever passion sway you<br />
Some noble love we all avow.<br />
<br />
"We bear a mark, an inward token,<br />
That parts us from the common herd.<br />
To each of us some muse has spoken<br />
A holy, unforgotten word.<br />
<br />
"Our stars, conjoined in youth's first season,<br />
Whether to musing moved or strife.<br />
Obedient to one touch of reason<br />
Together make the round of life.<br />
<br />
"Drink to the loves we knitted here,<br />
A bond by distance not undone.<br />
High thoughts outlive the wasted year;<br />
I drink to that which makes us one."<br />

<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I hear a rumour and a shout,</span><br />
A louder heart-throb pulses in the air.<br />
Fling, Muse, thy lattice open, and beware<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">To keep the morning out.</span><br />
Beckon into the chamber of thy care<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The bird of healing wing</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">That trilleth there</span><br />
Blithe happy passion of the strong and fair.<br />
Their wild heart singeth. Do thou also sing.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">How vain, how vain</span><br />
The feeble croaking of a reasoning tongue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">That heals no pain</span><br />
And prompts no bright deed worthy to be sung<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Too soon cold earth</span><br />
Refuses flowers. Oh, greet their lovely birth!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Too soon dull death</span><br />
Quiets the heaving of our doubtful breath.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Deem not its worth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Too high for honouring mirth;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Sing while the lyre is strung,</span><br />
And let the heart beat, while the heart is young.<br />
<br />
When the dank earth begins to thaw and yield<br />
The early clover, didst thou never pass<br />
Some balmy noon from field to sunny field<br />
And press thy feet against the tufted grass?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">So hadst thou seen</span><br />
A spring palæstra on the tender green.<br />
Here a tall stripling, with a woman's face,<br />
Draws the spiked sandal on his upturned heel,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Sure-footed for the race;</span><br />
Another hurls the quoit of heavy steel<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And glories to be strong;</span><br />
While yet another, lightest of the throng,<br />
Crouching on tiptoe for the sudden bound,<br />
Flies o'er the level race-course, like the hound,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And soon is lost afar;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Another jumps the bar,</span><br />
For some god taught him easily to spring,<br />
The legs drawn under, as a bird takes wing,<br />
Till, tempting fortune farther than is meet,<br />
At last he fails, and fails, and vainly tries,<br />
And blushing, and ashamed to lift his eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Shakes the light earth from his feet.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Him friendly plaudits greet</span><br />
And pleasing to the unaccustomed ear.<br />
Come then afield, come with the sporting year<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And watch the youth at play,</span><br />
For gentle is the strengthening sun, and sweet<br />
The soul of boyhood and the breath of May.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And with the milder ray</span><br />
Of the declining sun, when sky and shore,<br />
In purple drest and misty silver-grey.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Hang curtains round the day,</span><br />
Come list the beating of the plashing oar,<br />
For grief in rhythmic labour glides away.<br />
The glancing blades make circles where they dip,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Now flash and drip</span><br />
Cool wind-blown drops into the glassy river,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Now sink and cleave,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">While the lithe rowers heave</span><br />
And feel the boat beneath them leap and quiver.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The supple oars in time,</span><br />
Shattering the mirror of the rippled water,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">Fly, fly as poets climb,</span><br />
Borne by the pliant promise of their rhyme,<br />
Or as bewitched by Nereus' loveliest daughter<br />
The painted dolphins, following along,<br />
Leap to the measure of her liquid song.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">But the blasts of late October,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Tempering summer's paling grief</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">With a russet glow and sober,</span><br />
Bring of these sports the latest and the chief.<br />
Then bursts the flame from many a smouldering ember,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And many an ardent boy</span><br />
Woos harsher pleasures sweeter to remember,<br />
Hugged with a sterner and a tenser joy.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Look where the rivals come:</span><br />
Each little phalanx on its chosen ground<br />
Strains for the sudden shock, and all around<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The multitude is dumb.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Come, watch the stubborn fight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">And doubtful, in the sight</span><br />
Of wide-eyed beauty and unstinted love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Ay, the wise gods above,</span><br />
Attentive to this hot and generous fray,<br />
Smile on its fortunes and its end prepare,<br />
For play is also life, and far from care<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Their own glad life is play.</span><br />
<br />
Ye nymphs and fauns, to Bacchus dear,<br />
That woke Cithæron with your midnight rout,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Arise, arise and shout!</span><br />
Your day returns, your haunt is here.<br />
Shake off dull sleep and long despair;<br />
There is intoxication in this air,<br />
And frenzy in this yelping cheer.<br />
How oft of old the enraptured Muses sung<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Olympian victors' praise.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Lo! even in these days</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">The world is young.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Life like a torrent flung</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">For ever down</span><br />
For ever wears a rainbow for a crown.<br />
O idle sigh for loveliness outworn,<br />
When the red flush of each unfailing morn<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Floods every field and grove,</span><br />
And no moon wanes but some one is in love.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">O wasted tear,</span><br />
A new soul wakes with each awakened year.<br />
Beneath these rags, these blood-clots on the face,<br />
The valiant soul is still the same, the same<br />
The strength, the art, the inevitable grace,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">The thirst unquenched for fame</span><br />
Quenching base passion, the high will severe,<br />
The long obedience, and the knightly flame<br />
Of loyalty to honour and a name.<br />
<br />
Give o'er, ye chords, your music ere ye tire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Be sweetly mute, O lyre.</span><br />
Words soon are cold, and life is warm for ever.<br />
One half of honour is the strong endeavour,<br />
Success the other, but when both conspire<br />
Youth has her perfect crown, and age her old desire.<br />

LINES READ AT THE REUNION OF A COLLEGE CLUB<br />
<br />
<br />
Would you have an illustration<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of the thing we fellows are?</span><br />
Liken every generation<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To the bottles in the bar:</span><br />
Vessels full of precious liquor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Standing in their brave array,&mdash;Never</span><br />
bosom friends were thicker<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Or of franker heart than they,</span><br />
There congenially hobnobbing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Always ready for a bout,</span><br />
As half laughing and half sobbing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The fine spirits bubble out.</span><br />
<br />
We buy, break, drink, waste, decant them&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Bottles come and bottles go&mdash;</span><br />
Yet there always, when you want them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Stand the bottles in a row:</span><br />
Port and sherry, rum and brandy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Irish, Bourbon, Scotch, and rye,</span><br />
Always smiling, always handy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When the heart's a trifle dry.</span><br />
<br />
Though the bottles change their label<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And tag on another name,</span><br />
They're as welcome at the table,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For the liquor's still the same.</span><br />
Days gone by saw jugs in plenty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now less frequently on view.</span><br />
Every year some ten or twenty<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pass to fields and pastures new.</span><br />
There, replenished, they grow fatter<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And their bellies bulge amain,</span><br />
<br />
But though full as yet of matter,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You may mark a certain drain,</span><br />
For the busy world's contention<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Brings the liquid down a bit,</span><br />
And a small god I won't mention<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sometimes takes a pull at it.</span><br />
Yet apart from some mischances,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though not standing where they stood,</span><br />
For big dinners and small dances<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our old bottles still are good.</span><br />
But when once the dregs are emptied,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We throw bottles in a heap,</span><br />
Not one favourite exempted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Were its spirit fine or cheap.</span><br />
They 're doled out in the back alley<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By the scrawny hands of hags</span><br />
When gaunt Death comes shilly-shally<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Crying, "Bottles and old rags!"</span><br />
What of that? While face and feature,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Manners, minds, and pleasures pass,</span><br />
Mature breeds a younger creature.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mate to what the other was,</span><br />
And the sports we had forsaken,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the fancies blown away</span><br />
In the brighter souls they waken<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Live for ever and a day.</span><br />
The proud glories that entice us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">No more fail because we pass</span><br />
Than the founts of Dionysus<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For the quaffing of a glass.</span><br />
<br />
But what happens to the liquor?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The old bottles' fate to share,</span><br />
Only that its flight is quicker<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Up the vortices of air?</span><br />
Is it lost as soon as tasted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Rising upon moth-like wings</span><br />
To be caught and scorched and wasted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In this foolish flame of things?</span><br />
Ah, the blood of nature's spilling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Trickles back into her veins,</span><br />
And her cup is ever filling<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With the vintage that she strains.</span><br />
For a moment she befriends us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With unsealing of our eyes,</span><br />
But the light of life she lends us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Floods her everlasting skies.</span><br />
The sweet wine that makes our passion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Linking heart to mortal heart</span><br />
Is her ancient fire to fashion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All the marvels of her art.</span><br />
It has painted woman's beauty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It is parent to the flowers,</span><br />
It has wedded joy to duty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Portioned loves among the hours,</span><br />
Built us palaces and churches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Plucked its music from the lyre,</span><br />
Lighted all the spirit's searches<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Through the mazes of desire,</span><br />
Yes, and scorning earthly places<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And our human loves and wars</span><br />
It has peopled heaven's spaces<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And has gilded heaven's stars.</span><br />
<br />
Drink, then, of this cup and drain it.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Let the wine renew the soul,</span><br />
And all vessels that contain it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">May they long be sound and whole</span><br />
To receive the boon and give it<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That makes mortal joys divine.</span><br />
Here's to life and all who live it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To the bottles and the wine.</span><br />

<a id="THE_POETIC_MEDIUM"></a>THE POETIC MEDIUM<br />
<br />
<br />
In Chelsea dwells a Sibyl known to fame<br />
Called Mrs. Fakir&mdash;necromantic name!<br />
Past, present, future, open to her view<br />
She (for ten dollars) will reveal to you.<br />
I for less sums&mdash;the discount to the trade&mdash;<br />
Quaff at her fount and seek her undismayed.<br />
I found the priestess in her wonted lair<br />
Up three steep flights of narrow dirty stair.<br />
Chill was the darkened chamber. A thick fume<br />
Of kerosene lent odour to the gloom.<br />
Clothed in black weeds, pale, with delirious hair,<br />
Rocked Mrs. Fakir in her rocking-chair.<br />
I told my errand; with some hushed complaint<br />
About the fee, she fell into a faint,<br />
Thrice rolled her eyes, thrice snorted through her nose,<br />
Thrice wrung her hands, and wriggled thrice her toes,<br />
Then spoke. (I versify: she uttered vulgar prose.)<br />
"You want some verse: not every poet's soul<br />
Whose aid you crave is still in my control.<br />
Whom would you summon? You must ask the boon<br />
Of some frail wight that floats below the moon.<br />
The spirits that have risen to the stars<br />
Reck not the echoes of our earthly jars.<br />
Their troubles past, they have forgotten ours,<br />
And move unmoved by even magic powers.<br />
Only weak souls entangled in the mesh<br />
Of passion, dying, still are bond to flesh,<br />
And hover o'er the battle-field of life<br />
To smell their kindred blood and pine for strife.<br />
Such I may summon, for they have no choice<br />
Who crave to live again and find a voice."<br />
"'T is well," I answered. "If the gods so please,<br />
We will not call on Aristophanes,<br />
Horace shall slumber, Juvenal be dumb.<br />
They rest in peace. But haply Swift will come."<br />
"Not Swift," she said, "not Swift. I cannot tell<br />
Whether he flew to heaven or to hell,<br />
But he is gone far from this mild, low-born,<br />
And canting age, incapable of scorn."<br />
"Well, summon Byron, then," I said and sighed.<br />
"Byron is also safe," the witch replied.<br />
"The first sin punished and the first forgiven<br />
Is love's, the slip of climbers into heaven.<br />
The petted passion and the shallow dream<br />
He purged at last; the heart survived supreme."<br />
"Byron gone too," thought I, "what wit remains<br />
All younger sprites have water in their veins.<br />
But, ah! might not the living help me out?<br />
Don't phantoms of the living flit about?"<br />
"They do, they do," quoth Chelsea's Pythoness.<br />
"Here in my telepathic cave's recess<br />
All that they say or think or wish or feel<br />
I read aloud, but most what they conceal.<br />
Whom would you plagiarise? You 're silent? Why,<br />
Have you forgot the ages galaxy&mdash;"<br />
I trembled as she named them one by one,<br />
From Willy Frilly down to Spider Spun.<br />
"Spare me," I cried. "Shall some prolific bard<br />
Reel off bright lyrics at a cent a yard,<br />
All about April rain, December snow,<br />
The brook, the sunset, and the squawking crow?<br />
Shall little Swinburnes turn a verse with ease<br />
And sing the flaccid pleasures of disease?<br />
Shall mimics, drunk with each Castalian rill,<br />
Be any poet but themselves at will,<br />
Luscious when Keats, when Spenser quaint and dull,<br />
When Browning turgid, and Noodles null?<br />
Shall weaklings, in thick verse and tortured prose,<br />
Strike affectation's quintessential pose,<br />
Sniffing the odours of a perfumed brain<br />
Where melts a Wordsworth <i>plus</i> a Paul Verlaine?<br />
When, with no art, were precious fabrics wrought,<br />
When metaphysics with no mastering thought?<br />
No, Mrs. Fakir, none of this small fry.<br />
Catch me some ghost of sense, or else good-bye.<br />
Not at my bidding shall this choir prolong<br />
The cloying drivel of unmeaning song,<br />
Enrich the echo, maul the note and tease,<br />
Miauling nothing in a hundred keys.<br />
Better Pope's squirrel eye and polished sneer<br />
Than idiot mouthings, false without veneer.<br />
Better Boileau's 'monotony in wire,'<br />
Dressing good wit in periwigged attire;<br />
For in a garden's alleys or a wood<br />
Hung all in green, monotony is good,<br />
And a frail stem may need a bit of wire<br />
To keep the rose from trailing in the mire.<br />
Never will they dig deep or build for time<br />
Who of unreason weave a maze of rhyme,<br />
Worship a weakness, nurse a whim, and bind<br />
Wreaths about temples tenantless of mind,<br />
Forsake the path the seeing Muses trod,<br />
And shatter Nature to discover God.<br />
He only climbs the skies and proudly sings<br />
Whose heart, attentive, feels the pulse of things,<br />
Masters the fact, and hails the changeless goal<br />
That beckons, purges, and fulfils the soul."<br />
I ceased: no ghost was willing to befriend,<br />
And all the living useless to my end.<br />
Meantime the hag awoke with vacant stare,<br />
And passed her bony fingers through her hair.<br />
I left her den and hastened back to town,<br />
Writing the while my sad experience down.<br />
This you have heard. 'T is little that I give,<br />
But it makes sense. Long, masters, may you live.<br />

<br />
LINES WRITTEN BEFORE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1900<br />
<br />
<br />
Mid Uncle Sam's expanded acres<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">There's an old, secluded glade</span><br />
Where grey Puritans and Quakers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Still grow fervid in the shade;</span><br />
And the same great elms and beeches<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That once graced the ancestral farm,</span><br />
Bending to the old men's speeches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Lend their words an echo's charm.</span><br />
Laurel, clematis, and vine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Weave green trellises about,</span><br />
And three maples and a pine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shut the mucker-village out.</span><br />
Yet the smoke of trade and battle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cannot quite be banished hence,</span><br />
And the air-line to Seattle<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whizzes just behind the fence.</span><br />
<br />
As one day old Deacon Plaster<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hobbled to the wonted nook,</span><br />
There was Doctor Wise, the pastor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Meekly sitting with his book.</span><br />
"What has happened, Brother Deacon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That you look so hot and vexed?</span><br />
Is it something I might speak on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When I preach on Sabbath next?"</span><br />
"Doctor Wise," replied the other,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">As he wiped the sweat away,</span><br />
'T is a wicked sin, my brother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You should preach on every day.</span><br />
Cousin Sammy's gone a-tooting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To the Creole County fair,</span><br />
Where the very sun's polluting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And there's fever in the air</span><br />
He has picked up three young lasses,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Three mulattoes on the mart,</span><br />
Who have offered him free passes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To their fortune and their heart.</span><br />
One young woman he respected,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Vowed he only came to woo.</span><br />
But his word may be neglected<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Since he ravished the other two.</span><br />
In the Porto Rican billing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And carousing, I allow</span><br />
That the little minx was willing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though she may be sorry now.</span><br />
But what came of those embraces<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And that taint of nigger blood?</span><br />
Now he looks on outraged faces<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And can laugh, defying God:</span><br />
He can stretch his hand, relieving,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And strike down a cheated slave.</span><br />
Oh, if Uncle Sam were living,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">This would bring him to his grave!"</span><br />
<br />
Deacon Plaster ceased and, sighing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mopped the reeking of his brain.</span><br />
Doctor Wise, before replying,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Put his goggles on again.</span><br />
"Brother Plaster, to be candid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Were I managing the farm,</span><br />
I should do as the old man did&mdash;Lying<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">low and safe from harm,</span><br />
Shoot at poachers from the hedges,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If they ventured within range,</span><br />
Just round out my acre's edges,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Grow and grow, but never change.</span><br />
I am old, and you are old, sir:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Old the thoughts we live among.</span><br />
If the truth were to be told, sir,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">None of us was ever young.</span><br />
In the towns of sombre Britain&mdash;Merry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">England turned about&mdash;We</span><br />
were marked at birth and smitten<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Whom the Lord had chosen out;</span><br />
Picked to found a pilgrim nation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Far from men, estranged, remote,</span><br />
With the desert for a station<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the ocean for a moat;</span><br />
To rebuke by sober living,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the dread of wrath to come,</span><br />
Of the joys of this world's giving<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The abominable sum.</span><br />
Yet all passion's seeds came smuggled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In our narrow pilgrim ark,</span><br />
And, unwatered, grew and struggled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Pushed for ages through the dark,</span><br />
And, when summer granted pardon,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Burst into the upper air,</span><br />
Till that desert was a garden<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And that sea a thoroughfare.</span><br />
Thus the virtue we rely on<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Melted 'neath the heathen sun,</span><br />
And what should have been a Zion<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Came to be this Babylon.</span><br />
Ignorant of ancient sorrow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With hot young blood in their veins,</span><br />
Now the prophets of the morrow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ply the spur and hold the reins.</span><br />
Can we blame them? Rather blame us,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Us, who uttered idle things.</span><br />
Our false prophecies shall shame us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And our weak imaginings.</span><br />
Liberty! delicious sound!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The world loved it, and is free.</span><br />
But what's freedom? To be bound<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By a chance majority.</span><br />
Few are rich and many poor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though all minds show one dull hue.</span><br />
Equality we don't secure,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mediocrity we do.</span><br />
Ah! what dreams beguiled our youth!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Brothers we had hoped to be;</span><br />
But competition is the truth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of what we called fraternity.</span><br />
Can we blame them we mistaught<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If now they seek another guide</span><br />
And, since our wisdom comes to naught,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Take counsel of their proper pride?</span><br />
Nature beckons them, inviting<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To a deeper draught of fate,</span><br />
And, the heart's desire inciting,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Can we stop and bid them wait?</span><br />
<br />
"If old Uncle Sam were living,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">This, you say, should never be:</span><br />
Ah! if Uncle Sam were living,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He might weep, but he must see.</span><br />
Yet he died in time, believing<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the gods that ruled his days.</span><br />
We, alas! survive him, grieving<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Under gods we will not praise.</span><br />
The keen pleasures of December<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mean the joys of April lost;</span><br />
And shall rising suns remember<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All the dream worlds they have crossed?</span><br />
All things mortal have their season:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nothing lives, for ever young,</span><br />
But renews its life by treason<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To the thing from which it sprung,</span><br />
And when man has reached immortal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mansions, after toiling long,</span><br />
Life deserts him at the portal,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And he only lives in song.</span><br />
<br />
"As for Sam, the son, I wonder<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If you know the fellow's heart:</span><br />
There may yet be something under<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nobler than the outer part.</span><br />
When he told that señorita<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That he kissed and hugged her close</span><br />
Like a brother, did he cheat her?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Did he cheat himself? Who knows?</span><br />
That he liked her, that is certain;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That he wronged her is n't true.</span><br />
On his thoughts I draw the curtain:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I don't know them, nor do you.</span><br />
In her maid, the facile Rica,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We have quite another case.</span><br />
Hardly did he go to seek her,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When she rushed to his embrace.</span><br />
I confess it was improper,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But all flesh, alas! is flesh.</span><br />
Things had gone too far to drop her;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Each was in the other's mesh.</span><br />
But with that poor Filipina,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When she shrank from his caress,</span><br />
His contemptible demeanour<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Is n't easy to express.</span><br />
First he bought her, then he kicked her;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But the truth is, he was drunk,</span><br />
For that day had crowned him victor,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And a Spanish fleet was sunk.</span><br />
<br />
"You perceive I do not spare him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor am blinded to his motes</span><br />
By the Christian love I bear him;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Yes; he's sowing his wild oats.</span><br />
But you can't deny him talent;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Once his instinct is awake,</span><br />
He can play the part of gallant<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And of soldier and of rake.</span><br />
And it's something to have spirit<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though in rashness first expressed.</span><br />
Give me good blood to inherit:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Time and trial do the rest.</span><br />
He's not Uncle Sam, the father,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">That prim, pompous, pious man,</span><br />
Yankee, or Virginian, rather:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sammy's an American&mdash;</span><br />
Lavish, clever, loud, and pushing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Loving bargains, loving strife,</span><br />
Kindly, fearless-eyed, unblushing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Not yet settled down in life.</span><br />
Send him forth; the world will mellow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">His bluff youth, or nothing can.</span><br />
Nature made the hearty fellow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Life will make the gentleman.</span><br />
And if Cousin Sam is callow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">It was we who did the harm,</span><br />
Letting his young soul lie fallow&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The one waste spot in the farm&mdash;</span><br />
Trained by sordid inventories<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To scorn all he could n't buy,</span><br />
Puffed with miserable glories<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Shouted at an empty sky,</span><br />
Fooled with cant of a past era,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Droned 'twixt dreamy lid and lid,</span><br />
Till his God was a chimera<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And the living God was hid.</span><br />
Let him look up from his standard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To the older stars of heaven,</span><br />
Seaward by whose might, and landward,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All the tribes of men are driven;</span><br />
By whom ancient hopes were blasted,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ancient labours turned to dust;</span><br />
Whence the little that has lasted<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Borrows patience to be just:</span><br />
And beholding tribulation,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Seeing whither states are hurled,</span><br />
Let him sign his declaration<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of dependence on the world."</span><br />
<br />
Thus the Doctor's sermon ended;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The old Deacon shook his head,</span><br />
For his conscience was offended<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And his wits had lost the thread.</span><br />
So have mine, but there's my fable:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now, and when you cast your votes,</span><br />
Be as lenient as you 're able<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On "Young Sammy's First Wild Oats."</span><br />

<a id="SPAIN_IN_AMERICA"></a>SPAIN IN AMERICA<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When scarce the echoes of Manila Bay,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Circling each slumbering billowy hemisphere,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had met where Spain's forlorn Armada lay</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Locked amid hostile hills, and whispered near</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The double omen of that groan and cheer&mdash;Haste</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">to do now what must be done anon</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or some mad hope of selling triumph dear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drove the ships forth: soon was <i>Teresa</i> gone,</span><br />
<i>Furór, Pluton, Vizcaya, Oquendo</i>, and <i>Colón</i>.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when the second morning dawned serene</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O'er vivid waves and foam-fringed mountains, dressed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like Nessus in their robe's envenomed sheen,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Scarce by some fiery fleck the place was guessed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where each hulk smouldered; while from crest to crest</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leapt through the North the news of victory,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Victory tarnished by a boorish jest</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet touched with pity, lest the unkindly sea</span><br />
Should too much aid the strong and leave no enemy.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the anguished soul, that gasped for difficult breath,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passes to silence from its house of pain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So from those wrecks, in fumes of lurid death,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passed into peace the heavy pride of Spain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Passed from that aching tenement, half fain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Back to her castled hills and windy moors,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No longer tossed upon the treacherous main</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once boasted hers, which with its watery lures</span><br />
Too long enticed her sons to unhallowed sepultures.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Why went Columbus to that highland race,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Frugal and pensive, prone to love and ire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Despising kingdoms for a woman's face,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For honour riches and for faith desire?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On Spain's own breast was snow, within it fire;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In her own eyes and subtle tongue was mirth;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The eternal brooded in her skies, whence nigher</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The trebled starry host admonished earth</span><br />
To shame away her grief and mock her baubles' worth.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah! when the crafty Tyrian came to Spain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To barter for her gold his motley wares,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Treading her beaches he forgot his gain.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Semite became noble unawares.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her passion breathed Hamilcar's cruel prayers;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her fiery winds taught Hannibal his vows;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out of her tribulations and despairs</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They wove a sterile garland for their brows.</span><br />
To her sad ports they fled before the Roman prows.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the Greek coming too forgot his art,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And that large temperance which made him wise.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wonder of her mountains choked his heart,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The languor of her gardens veiled his eyes;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He dreamed, he doubted; in her deeper skies</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He read unfathomed oracles of woe,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And stubborn to the onward destinies,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like some dumb brute before a human foe,</span><br />
Sank in Saguntum's flames and deemed them brighter so.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The mighty Roman also when he came,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bringing his gods, his justice, and his tongue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Put off his greatness for a sadder fame,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And what a Cæsar wrought a Lucan sung.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor was the pomp of his proud music, wrung</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From Latin numbers, half so stern and dire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor the sad majesties he moved among</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Half so divine, as her unbreathed desire.</span><br />
Shall longing break the heart and not untune the lyre?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When after many conquerors came Christ,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The only conqueror of Spain indeed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not Bethlehem nor Golgotha sufficed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To show him forth, but every shrine must bleed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And every shepherd in his watches heed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The angels' matins sung at heaven's gate.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor seemed the Virgin Mother wholly freed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From taint of ill if born in frail estate,</span><br />
But shone the seraphs' queen and soared immaculate.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And when the Arab from his burning sands</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swept o'er the waters like a heavenly flail,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He took her lute into his conquering hands,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And in her midnight turned to nightingale.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With woven lattices and pillars frail</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He screened the pleasant secrets of his bower,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet little could his subtler arts avail</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against the brutal onset of the Giaour.</span><br />
The rose passed from his courts, the muezzin from his tower.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Only one image of his wisdom stayed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One only relic of his magic lore,&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Allah the Great, whom silent fate obeyed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">More than Jehovah calm and hidden more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Allah remained in her heart's kindred core</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">High witness of these terrene shifts of wrong.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into his ancient silence she could pour</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her passions' frailty&mdash;He alone is strong&mdash;</span><br />
And chant with lingering wail the burden of her song.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seizing at Covadonga the rude cross</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pelayo raised amid his mountaineers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She bore it to Granada, one day's loss</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ransomed with battles of a thousand years.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A nation born in harness, fed on tears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Christened in blood, and schooled in sacrifice,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All for a sweeter music in the spheres,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All for a painted heaven&mdash;at a price</span><br />
Should she forsake her loves and sail to Ind for spice?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had Genoa in her merchant palaces</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No welcome for a heaven-guided son?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had Venice, mistress of the inland seas,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No ships for bolder venture? Pisa none?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was sated Rome content? Her mission done?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saw Lusitania in her seaward dreams</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No floating premonition, beckoning on</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To vast horizons, gilded yet with gleams</span><br />
Of old Atlantis, whelmed beneath the bubbling streams?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or if some torpor lay upon the South,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Tranced by the might of memories divine,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dwelt no shrewd princeling by the marshy mouth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Scheldt, or by the many mouths of Rhine?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rode Albion not at anchor in the brine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose throne but now the thrifty Tudor stole</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Changing a noble for a crafty line?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swarmed not the Norsemen yet about the pole,</span><br />
Seeking through endless mists new havens for the soul?<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These should have been thy mates, Columbus, these</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Patrons and partners of thy enterprise,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sad lovers of immeasurable seas,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bound to no hallowed earth, no peopled skies.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No ray should reach them of their ladies' eyes</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In western deserts: no pure minstrel's rhyme,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Echoing in forest solitudes, surprise</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their heart with longing for a sweeter clime.</span><br />
These, these should found a world who drag no chains of time.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In sooth it had seemed folly, to reveal</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To stubborn Aragon and evil-eyed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">These perilous hopes, folly to dull Castile</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Moated in jealous faith and walled in pride,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Save that those thoughts, to Spain's fresh deeds allied,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Painted new Christian conquests, and her hand</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Itched for that sword, now dangling at her side,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which drove the Moslem forth and purged the land.</span><br />
And then she dreamed a dream her heart could understand.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Three caravels, a cross upon the prow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A broad cross on the banner and the sail,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The liquid fields of Hesperus should plough</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Borne by the leaping waters and the gale.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Before that sign all hellish powers should quail</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Troubling the deep: no dragon's obscene crest,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No serpent's slimy coils should aught avail,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till ivory cities looming in the west</span><br />
Should gleam from high Cathay or Araby the Blest,<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, as with noble mien and debonair</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The captains from the galleys leapt to land,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or down the temple's alabaster stair</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or by the river's marge of silvery sand,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Proud Sultans should descend with outstretched hand</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Greeting the strangers, and by them apprised</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Christ's redemption and the Queen's command,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Being with joy and gratitude baptised,</span><br />
Should lavish gifts of price by rarest art devised.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Or if (since churls there be) they should demur</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">To some least point of fealty or faith,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">A champion, clad in arms from crest to spur,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Should challenge the proud caitiffs to their death</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And, singly felling them, from their last breath</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Extort confession that the Lord is lord,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And India's Catholic queen, Elizabeth.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Whereat yon turbaned tribes, with one accord,</span><br />
Should beat their heathen breasts and ope their treasures' horde.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or, if the worst should chance and high debates</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should end in insult and outrageous deed,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, many Christians rudely slain, their mates</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should summon heaven to their direful need,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Suddenly from the clouds a snow-white steed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bearing a dazzling rider clad in flames</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should plunge into the fray: with instant speed</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Rout all the foe at once, while mid acclaims</span><br />
The slaughtered braves should rise, crying, <i>Saint James! Saint James!</i><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then, the day won, and its bright arbiter</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Vanished, save for peace he left behind,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each in his private bosom should bestir</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Plis dearest dream: as that perchance there pined</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some lovely maiden of angelic mind</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In those dark towers, awaiting out of Spain</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Two Saviours that her horoscope divined</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should thence arrive. She (womanlike) were fain</span><br />
Not to be wholly free, but wear a chosen chain.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That should be youth's adventure. Riper days</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Would crave the guerdon of a prouder power</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And pluck their nuggets from an earthly maze</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For rule and dignity and children's dower.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And age that thought to near the fatal hour</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Should to a magic fount descend instead,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose waters with the fruit revive the flower</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And deck in all its bloom the ashen head,</span><br />
Where a green heaven spreads, not peopled of the dead.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By such false meteors did those helmsmen steer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such phantoms filled their vain and vaulting souls</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With divers ardours, while this brooding sphere</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Swung yet ungirdled on her silent poles.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All journeys took them farther from their goals,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All battles won defeated their desire,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Barred from one India by the other's shoals,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each sighted star extinguishing its fire,</span><br />
Cape doubled after cape, and never haven nigher.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How many galleons sailed to sail no more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">How many battles and how many slain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since first Columbus touched the Cuban shore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till Aurocania felt the yoke of Spain!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What mounting miseries! What dwindling gain!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To till those solitudes, soon swept of gold,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bear that ardent sun, across the main</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Slaves must come writhing in the festering hold</span><br />
Of galleys.&mdash;Poison works, though men be brave and bold.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That slothful planter, once the buccaneer,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lord of his bastards and his mongrel clan,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ignorant, harsh, what could he list or hear</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of Europe and the heritage of man?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No petty schemer sees the larger plan,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No privy tyrant brooks the mightier law,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But lash in hand rides forth a partisan</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of freedom: base, without the touch of awe,</span><br />
He poisoned first the blood his poniard was to draw.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By sloth and lust and mindlessness and pelf</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spain sank in sadness and dishonour down,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each in her service serving but himself,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Each in his passion striking at her crown.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not that these treasons blotted her renown</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Emblazoned higher than such hands can reach:</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There where she reaped but sorrow she has sown</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The balm of sorrow; all she had to teach</span><br />
She taught the younger world&mdash;her faith and heart and speech.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now within her sea-girt walls withdrawn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She waits in silence for the healing years,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">While where her sun has set a second dawn</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Comes from the north, with other hopes and fears.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spain's daughters stand, half ceasing from their tears,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And watch the skies from Cuba to the Horn.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"What is this dove or eagle that appears,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They seem to cry, "what herald of what morn</span><br />
Hovers o'er Andes' peaks in love or guile or scorn?"<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"O brooding Spirit, fledgling of the North,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Winged for the levels of its shifting light,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Child of a labouring ocean and an earth</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shrouded in vapours, fear the southward flight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dread waveless waters and their warm delight,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beware of peaks that cleave the cloudless blue</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hold communion with the naked night.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The souls went never back that hither flew,</span><br />
But sighing fell to earth or broke the heavens through.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Haunt still thy storm-swept islands, and endure</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The shimmering forest where thy visions live.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Then if we love thee&mdash;for thy heart is pure&mdash;Thou</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">shalt have something worthy love to give.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thrust not thy prophets on us, nor believe</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy sorry riches in our eyes are fair.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Thy unctuous sophists never will deceive</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A mortal pang, or charm away despair.</span><br />
Not for the stranger's fee we plait our lustrous hair.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"But of thy lingering twilight bring some gleam,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Memorial of the immaterial fire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lighting thy heart, and to a wider dream</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Waken the music of our plaintive lyre.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Check our rash word, hush, hush our base desire.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hang paler clouds of reverence about</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our garish skies: laborious hope inspire</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That uncomplaining walks the paths of doubt,</span><br />
A wistful heart within, a mailed breast without.<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Gold found is dross, but long Promethean art</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Transmutes to gold the unprofitable ore.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bring labour's joy, yet spare that better part</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our mother, Spain, bequeathed to all she bore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For who shall covet if he once adore?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Leave in our skies, strange Spirit passing there,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">No less of vision but of courage more,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of our worship take thy equal share,</span><br />
Thou who wouldst teach us hope, with her who taught us prayer."<br />

<br />
<br />
What, when hearts have met, shall sever<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heart from heart, though heaven fall?</span><br />
They alone are dead for ever<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who have never lived at all.</span><br />
Roses that have bloomed to sweetness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Never can untimely fade,</span><br />
Blessed by death in their completeness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And on beauty's bosom laid,</span><br />
Garnered in the breast eternal<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where all noble joys are one,</span><br />
Sweet Elysium, fair and vernal,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where they mount who face the sun.</span><br />
Happy he whom men call lonely,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose companion is the truth,</span><br />
And whose heart is ravished only<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the world's immortal youth.</span><br />
Happy he whose single treasure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is the infinite unfurled,</span><br />
And whose voice has caught the measure<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the music of the world.</span><br />
When Death gathers up our ashes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our sorry shades depart,</span><br />
Lo, Life's flame, rekindled, flashes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From another mortal heart,</span><br />
And Death turns about, derided<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the Life he would deride.</span><br />
Vainly space and time divided<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What eternity allied.</span><br />
One great hope guides all our seeing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One pure heaven lends us light.</span><br />
Love is still the crown of being,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Faith the better part of sight.</span><br />
The same wisdom's ancient pages<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stir again the generous soul</span><br />
To the mighty task of ages<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Crawling still to reason's goal.</span><br />
The prophetic Muse of Story<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sings her ancient legend o'er,</span><br />
And the sea, still young and hoary,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Chants along the beaten shore.</span><br />
Spring yet yields her flowery treasures<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the guiltless hands of boys,</span><br />
Chastening their noisy pleasures<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the depth of human joys.</span><br />
One eternal passion drives us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Zealots of the stars above,</span><br />
And our better part survives us,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Living in the things we love.</span><br />
